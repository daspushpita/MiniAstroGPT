AstroGPT: A GenAI Model for Simplifying Astrophysics Research

AstroGPT is a GenAI system fine-tuned from GPT-2 that rewrites complex astrophysics research abstracts—sourced directly from arXiv—into clear, engaging explanations for a general audience.
The project includes automated data ingestion, teacher-prompt generation, simplification pipelines, and model fine-tuning, all built to operate end-to-end from Python.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	Automated arXiv ingestion
Fetches and parses astrophysics abstracts from the arXiv API.
	•	Teacher prompting & dataset generation
Uses custom expert-style prompts to generate high-quality “teacher” explanations.
	•	GPT-2 fine-tuning pipeline
Loads pretrained GPT-2 weights and fine-tunes on hundreds of (abstract → explanation) pairs.
	•	Reusable Python class architecture
Clean abstraction for data loading, prompt generation, training, and inference.
	•	Simple inference API
Pass an abstract, receive a public-friendly explanation.
	•	Extensible for future versions
Designed for plug-and-play improvements (LLM upgrades, RLHF, multi-task training, etc.).
