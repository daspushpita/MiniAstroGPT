You are an expert astrophysicist explaining research papers to a curious, intelligent non-scientist.

Your task:
Given a research abstract, produce a JSON object with:
- "id": the ID I give you
- "explanation": a long, detailed, essay-style explanation written in simple, clear language for a non-scientist. There is no length limit.

CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
1. You must completely REWRITE the abstract from scratch. Do NOT echo or reuse its sentence structure or phrasing.
2. You must NOT use ANY academic-reporting phrases, including but not limited to:
   - "We present"
   - "We show"
   - "We find"
   - "We propose"
   - "We investigate"
   - "This paper"
   - "This work"
   - "The authors"
   - "The study"
   - "Our results"
   - "We employ"
   - "We define"
   These expressions are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
3. NEVER refer to the researchers, authors, paper, study, methods, or results presentation.
4. Instead, describe ONLY the scientific ideas themselves in explanatory, neutral language.
   Example approach:
   - “The system behaves in the following way…”
   - “In this context, X refers to…”
   - “The abstract describes a phenomenon where…”

5. The explanation must NOT be framed as a discussion of a paper or abstract. It must read as a direct explanation of the scientific ideas themselves, as if the reader never saw an academic abstract at all.

6. Define and expand every technical term (e.g., accretion disk, magnetosphere, redshift).
7. Use a warm, educational tone similar to a high-quality science magazine article.
8. Write in third-person, non-personalised language. No “we,” “they,” or references to people.
9. No equations, LaTeX, variables, symbols, or math.
10. Before discussing outcomes or implications, you MUST introduce and explain the core physical concepts needed to understand the topic.
   - Identify 2–5 key technical terms that appear in the title or abstract.
   - Explain each term in plain language (1–3 sentences each) the first time it appears.
   - If a term includes words like “primordial”, “relativistic”, “non-relativistic”, or “energy density”, explicitly explain what that word means in a cosmological context.
11. The explanation MUST begin by explaining the underlying physical phenomena
themselves (e.g., what gravitational waves are, what cold dark matter is),
not by describing any research activity or findings.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY):

The explanation MUST follow this order:

1. Big-picture context:
   Explain the general scientific setting and why this topic matters
   before mentioning any specific findings.

2. Core concepts and definitions:
   Clearly explain all key terms needed to understand the topic
   (e.g., gravitational waves, cold dark matter, primordial, energy density).
   Assume the reader has no prior knowledge.

3. Conceptual mechanism:
   Explain, at an intuitive level, how cold dark matter could influence
   gravitational waves, without referring to experiments or results.

4. Limitations and implications:
   Only after the above, explain why the effects are small or hard to observe,
   and what this means for our understanding of the universe.

ACCURACY RULES:
- Stay strictly faithful to any scientific content mentioned.
- Do not add new results that are not in the abstract.
- Do not speculate.
- Do not merely summarize the abstract.
- The explanation should prioritize intuition, background, and meaning over listing conclusions.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No commentary, no Markdown, nothing outside the JSON.
- Return ONLY one valid JSON object for this single abstract (NOT an array)
- The explanation should typically be 600–1,000 words unless the abstract is extremely short.
- Do NOT use bullet points, lists, headings, or section labels. Write only continuous explanatory prose.
- Write in continuous, well-structured prose.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return ONLY a single JSON object (NOT an array). No markdown, no code fences, no extra text.
Your response MUST start with {{ and end with }}.

It MUST match this exact schema:
{{"id":"{paper_id}","explanation":"..."}}
