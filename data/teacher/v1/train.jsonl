The filament stretched over more than half a solar diameter. Multiwavelength data from the SDO instrument AIA (171, 193, 304, and 211Å) were used to examine counter-streaming flows within the spine of the filament. H images from the Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory provided context information. We apply local correlation tracking (LCT) to a two-hour time series on 2011 Nov. 16 of the AIA images to derive horizontal flow velocities of the filament. To enhance the contrast of the AIA images, noise adaptive fuzzy equalization is employed, which allows us to identify and quantify counter-streaming flows in the filament. We detect counter-streaming flows in the filament, which are visible in the time-lapse movies in all examined AIA wavelength bands. In the time-lapse movies we see that these persistent flows lasted for at least two hours. Furthermore, by applying LCT to the images we clearly determine counter-streaming flows in time series of 171 and 193Å images. In the 304Å wavelength band, we only see minor indications for counter-streaming flows with LCT, while in the 211Å wavelength band the counter-streaming flows are not detectable. The average horizontal flows reach mean flow speeds of 0.5 km/s. The highest horizontal flow speeds are identified in the 171Å band with flow speeds of up to 2.5 km/s. The results are averaged over a time series of 90 min. Because the LCT sampling window has finite width, a spatial degradation cannot be avoided leading to lower estimates of the flow velocities as compared to feature tracking or Doppler measurements.

This light travel time effect (LTTE) has been applied to transits and eclipses for a variety of purposes, including studies of eclipse timing variations (ETVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs) that reveal the presence of additional bodies in the system.

This asymmetry can be due to a non-unity mass ratio or to the presence of external barycentric motion. Although usually constant, this barycentric and asymmetric transverse velocities (BATV) effect can vary between sequential eclipses if either the path length between the two objects or the barycentric transverse velocity varies in time. We discuss this BATV effect and estimate its magnitude for both time-dependent and time-independent cases. For the time-dependent cases, we consider binaries that experience a change in orbital inclination, eccentric systems with and without apsidal motion, and hierarchical triple systems.

Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky planets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars with a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star clusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely long-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs, and comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more limited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance the threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but the probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always be substantially below 100% for any environment.

The surface structures and dynamics of cool stars are characterized by the presence of convective motions and turbulent flows which shape the emergent spectrum. Aims. We used realistic three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations from the Stagger-grid to calculate synthetic spectra with the radiative transfer code Optim3D for stars with different stellar parameters to predict photometric colors and convective velocity shifts. Methods. We calculated spectra from 1000 to 200 000 A with a constant resolving power of 20 000 and from 8470 and 8710 A (Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer - RVS - spectral range), with a constant resolving power of 300 000. Results. We used synthetic spectra to compute theoretical colors in the Johnson-Cousins UBV(RI), SDSS, 2MASS, Gaia, SkyMapper, Stromgren systems, and HST-WFC3. We showed that 1D versus 3D differences are limited to a small percent except for the narrow filters that span the optical and UV region of the spectrum. In addition, we derived the effect of the convective velocity fields on selected Fe I lines. We found the overall convective shift for 3D simulations with respect to the reference 1D hydrostatic models, revealing line shifts of between -0.235 and +0.361 km/s. We showed a net correlation of the convective shifts with the effective temperature: lower effective temperatures denote redshifts and higher effective temperatures denote blueshifts.

We investigate for the first time the nucleosynthesis of p nuclides in GCE by including metallicity and progenitor mass-dependent yields of core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) into a chemical evolution model. We used a grid of metallicities and progenitor masses from two different sets of stellar yields and followed the contribution of ccSNe to the Galactic abundances as function of time. In combination with previous studies on p-nucleus production in thermonuclear supernovae (SNIa), and using the same GCE description, this allows us to compare the respective roles of SNeIa and ccSNe in the production of p-nuclei in the Galaxy. The gamma process in ccSN is very efficient for a wide range of progenitor masses (13M_sun_- 25M_sun) at solar metallicity. Since it is a secondary process with its efficiency depending on the initial abundance of heavy elements, its contribution is strongly reduced below solar metallicity.

In particular, we find that ccSNe contribute less than 10% of the solar p nuclide abundances, with only a few exceptions.

For this reason, the present work adopts a different approach in assessing massive halos by constructing wave-halo solutions directly from the wave distribution function. This approach bears certain similarity with the analytical construction of particle-halo (cold dark matter model).

For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the planet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into a gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation mass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous measurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all relevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical simulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling law that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent viscosity parameter . We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas, with Stokes number can drift through the partial gap at pebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must be decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent diffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble isolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background viscosity and on the pebble size.

The two other stars are DO white dwarfs: WD0111+002 has Teff=58,000 K and logg=7.7, and PG0109+111 has Teff=70,000 K and logg=8.0. These stars trace the onset of element diffusion during early WD evolution. While zinc is the only trans-iron element we could detect in the PG1159 star, both DOs exhibit lines from Zn, Ga, Ge, Se; one additionally exhibits lines from Sr, Sn, Te, and I and the other from As. Generally, the trans-iron elements are very abundant in the DOs, meaning that radiative levitation must be acting. Most extreme is the almost six orders of magnitude oversolar abundance of tellurium in PG0109+111. In terms of mass fraction, it is the most abundant metal in the atmosphere.

Providing observational constraints on the locations of the major snowlines is therefore crucial for fully connecting planet compositions to their formation mechanism. Unfortunately, the most important snowline, that of water, is very difficult to observe directly in protoplanetary disks due to its close proximity to the central star. Based on chemical considerations, HCO is predicted to be a good chemical tracer of the water snowline, because it is particularly abundant in dense clouds when water is frozen out.

The H CO emission peaks ~2\" northeast of the continuum peak, whereas the previously observed H O shows compact emission on source. Quantitative modeling shows that a decrease in H CO abundance by at least a factor of six is needed in the inner ~360 AU to reproduce the observed emission profile. Chemical modeling predicts indeed a steep increase in HCO just outside the water snowline; the 50% decrease in gaseous H O at the snowline is not enough to allow HCO to be abundant.

We show that such TDEs sourced by realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids and massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to interstellar space up to 30% of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional fragmentation, caused by convergent vertical motion of the disrupted planetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the original mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum of ISAs (very different from the top-heavy distributions expected in other scenarios) implies that planetary TDEs can account for a significant fraction (up to ~30% under optimistic assumptions) of the ISAs.

(2017), including the effect of thermal feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here, we further investigate this picture, by tracing back in time the spatial origin and metallicity evolution of the gas residing at z=0 in the outskirts of simulated galaxy clusters. In these regions, we find a large distribution of iron abundances, including a component of highly-enriched gas, already present at z=2. At z>1, the gas in the present-day outskirts was distributed over tens of virial radii from the the main cluster and had been already enriched within high-redshift haloes.

This confirms that the in situ enrichment of the ICM in the outskirts of present-day clusters does not play a significant role, and its uniform metal abundance is rather the consequence of the accretion of both low-metallicity and pre-enriched (at z>2) gas, from the diffuse component and through merging substructures.

We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging.

This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are governed primarily by interstellar turbulence which sets purely lognormal density PDFs. In the gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low density gas resides in the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally unstable past a critical density ( ), and the PDF begins to forms a power law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional density ( ) between the lognormal and power law portions of the PDF moves towards lower-density while the slope of the power law ( ) becomes increasingly shallow. The star formation rate per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over the lognormal from to and an integral over the power law from to the maximum density. As becomes shallower the SFR accelerates beyond the expected values calculated from a lognormal density PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per free fall time in observations of local molecular cloud increases with shallower PDF power law slopes, in agreement with our model.

We review the various mechanisms proposed for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Various in-situ mechanisms have been suggested, which allow for the incorporation of water into the local planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region or into the planets themselves from local sources, although all of those mechanisms have difficulties. Comets have also been proposed as a source, although there may be problems fitting isotopic constraints, and the delivery efficiency is very low, such that it may be difficult to deliver even a single Earth ocean of water this way. The most promising route for water delivery is the accretion of material from beyond the snow line, similar to carbonaceous chondrites, that is scattered into the terrestrial planet region as the planets are growing. Two main scenarios are discussed in detail. First is the classical scenario in which the giant planets begin roughly in their final locations and the disk of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region extends all the way into the outer asteroid belt region. Second is the Grand Tack scenario, where early inward and outward migration of the giant planets implants material from beyond the snow line into the asteroid belt and terrestrial planet region, where it can be accreted by the growing planets.

Our motivation is to obtain new spectra along with photometric measurements, to analyze what kind of changes may have happened in the system in the past two decades, and to propose new ideas for explaining them. Methods. For the period analysis we determined 10 new times of minima from our light curves, and constructed a new O C diagram of the system.

All observed spectra were compared to synthetic spectra and equivalent widths of the H line were measured on their differences. Results. We have re-determined the physical parameters of the system according to our new light curve and spectral models.

Specifically, we analyze the production of turbulence by g-modes generated by the supersonic expansion and buoyant rise of AGN-driven bubbles. Previous work which neglects magnetic fields has shown that this process is inefficient, with less than 1% of the injected energy ending up in turbulence. This inefficiency is primarily due to the fact that the bubbles are shredded apart by hydrodynamic instabilities before they can excite sufficiently strong g-modes. Using a plane-parallel model of the ICM and 3D ideal MHD simulations, we examine the role of a large-scale magnetic field which is able to drape around these rising bubbles, preserving them from hydrodynamic instabilities. We find that, while magnetic draping appears better able to preserve AGN-driven bubbles, the driving of g-modes and the resulting production of turbulence is still inefficient. The magnetic tension force prevents g-modes from transitioning into the nonlinear regime, suppressing turbulence in our model ICM.

The synchrotron emission of jets can be highly linearly polarised, depending on the configuration of the magnetic field. Optical and infrared (OIR) polarimetric observations of X-ray binaries are presented in this brief review. The OIR polarimetric signature of relativistic jets is detected at levels of ~ 1-10 %, similar to AGN cores. This reveals that the magnetic geometry in the compact jets may be similar for supermassive and stellar-mass BHs. The magnetic fields near the jet base in most of these systems appear to be turbulent, variable and on average, aligned with the jet axis, although there are some exceptions.

The former is strictly coupled to the gas, while the latter interacts with the gas via friction. The conversion of small to grown dust, dust growth, and dust self-gravity are also considered. We found that the process of dust growth known for the older protoplanetary phase also holds for the embedded phase of disk evolution. The dust growth efficiency depends on the radial distance from the star - a_r is largest in the inner disk and gradually declines with radial distance. In the inner disk, a_r is limited by the dust fragmentation barrier. The process of small-to-grown dust conversion is very fast once the disk is formed.

We considered a 1-bar atmosphere whose composition is similar to the current Earth's atmosphere with a zonally uniform distribution of surface water.

In certain conditions, this can lead to a twist in the loop, which drives the loop unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value. The possibility that a solar flare is caused by such a twist-induced instability in a loop has been in the literature for decades.

For relatively large flares, we find that the slope of the power law is shallower.

We find that this mechanism could have supplied prebiotically relevant levels of SO -derived anions, but not H S-derived anions. Radiative transfer modelling suggests UV light would have remained abundant on the planet surface for all but the largest volcanic explosions. We apply our results to the case study of the proposed prebiotic reaction network of Patel et al. (2015), and discuss the implications for improving its prebiotic plausibility. In general, epochs of moderately high volcanism could have been especially conducive to cyanosulfidic prebiotic chemistry.

Those chemical transitions are accompanied by spectral transitions whose sharpness cannot be explained by chemistry alone. In a series of articles, Tremblin et al. proposed that some of the yet unexplained features associated to these transitions could be explained by a reduction of the thermal gradient near the photosphere. To explain, in turn, this more isothermal profile, they invoke the presence of an instability analogous to fingering convection -- compositional convection -- triggered by the change in mean molecular weight of the gas due to the chemical transitions mentioned above. In this short note, we use existing arguments to demonstrate that any turbulent transport, if present, would in fact increase the thermal gradient. This misinterpretation comes from the fact that turbulence mixes/homogenizes entropy (potential temperature) instead of temperature. So, while increasing transport, turbulence in an initially stratified atmosphere actually carries energy downward, whether it is due to fingering or any other type of compositional convection.

We also report seven CO detections (7/39) down to log N(CO)~13.5, including a new one, and put stringent constraints on N(CO) for the remaining 32 systems. N(CO) and N(CI) are found to be strongly correlated with N(CO)/N(CI)~1/10. This suggests that the CI-selected absorber population is probing gas deeper than the HI-H2 transition in which a substantial fraction of the total hydrogen in the cloud is in the form of H2. We conclude that targeting CI-bearing absorbers is a very efficient way to find high-metallicity molecular absorbers.

The motion of tectonic plates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface over geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is driven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e., the cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not occur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until ~2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it cycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface. Water affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics and, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic history models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically constrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by variations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate does not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth.

We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar evolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used a stellar model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain seismically inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 γDoradus stars observed by Kepler. We show that the buoyancy radius can be used as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the MS. We computed rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in radiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the CESTAM code. This code calculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of the RGB. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear disagreement between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and the rotation rates obtained from evolutionary models including rotationally induced transport following Zahn (1992).

It is suggested that spiral galaxies may have started as compact objects with significant angular momenta and then disintegrated. The first model conjectures the existence of a spinning hot disk around a spherical galactic core. The disk is held together by local gravity and electromagnetic scattering forces. However, it disintegrates at the edge producing fragments that form stars. Once separated from the disk, the stars experience only the centrally directed gravitational force due to the massive core and remaining disk.

The second model conjectures a significant initial thermonuclear event that produces a dust plume along with large stars. This dust plume is made of ordinary matter. However, it acts like the postulated dark matter in producing initial circular trajectories. Unlike dark matter, the plume can be shown to escape the galaxy rapidly causing the star trajectories to evolve to hyperbolic shapes.

A major problem with previous studies is the small number of simulations performed and the implied poor exploration of the large nova parameter space. We report the results of a different strategy, based on a Monte Carlo technique, that involves the random sampling over the most important nova model parameters: the white dwarf composition; the mixing of the outer white dwarf layers with the accreted material before the explosion; the peak temperature and density; the explosion time scales; and the possible dilution of the ejecta after the outburst.

Here we show that spectrographs with a novel design - in particular a large spectral range - can open exoplanet characterisation to smaller telescope facilities too. We aim to demonstrate the concept on a series of spectra of the exoplanet HD 189733 b taken at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo with the near-infrared spectrograph GIANO during two transits of the planet. In contrast to absorption in the Earth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum shifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of the planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the signal of the exoplanet. The latter is then extracted by cross-correlating the residual spectra with template models of the planet atmosphere computed through line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and containing molecular absorption lines from water and methane.
