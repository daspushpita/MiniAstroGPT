Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\\mathrm{M}_V \\lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal \"tug-of-war\" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.","published":"2025-09-08T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Methods. Our new approach for automatically identifying four-image lens configurations in large catalogues is based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification algorithm. To train this supervised algorithm, we performed realistic simulations of lenses with four images that account for the statistical distribution of the morphology of the deflecting halos as measured in the EAGLE simulation. We identified the parameters discriminant for the classification and performed two different trainings, namely, with and without distance information. Results. The performances of this method on the simulated data are quite good, with a true positive rate and a true negative rate of about 99.99% and 99.84%, respectively. Our validation of the method on a small set of known quasar lenses demonstrates its efficiency, with 75% of known lenses being correctly identified.

We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\\sim 10\\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution.

These have been considered signposts of a hot white dwarf (WD) companion in a symbiotic system (SySt), but AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine these companions hampering their detection at optical wavelengths. A recent multi-wavelength investigation on the X-ray-emitting AGB (X-AGB) star Y Gem has confirmed the presence of a WD companion and, thus, its SySt nature. Our goal is to explore the true nature of another X-AGB star, namely CGCS 6306, to investigate whether some objects from this group may in fact be unnoticed symbiotic systems with AGB donors. Optical spectra and photometric data, together with X-ray observations, have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in CGCS 6306. CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 362 days. Its optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to H I and He I recombination and [O I] and [O III] forbidden emission lines. The H$\\alpha$ line profile is broad, which can be interpreted as evidence for an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is hard, typical of highly-extincted hot plasma emission, and the X-ray luminosity is $\\approx10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of high-excitation optical emission lines and the X-ray properties of CGCS 6306 confirm the presence of a WD companion, making it a bona-fide $\\delta$-type X-SySt. Its X-ray luminosity is comparable to that of Y Gem, the other X-AGB confirmed to be a SySt, which was found to exhibit a high accretion rate. The lack of suitable information on the UV and blue optical properties of CGCS 6306, however, precludes a definitive estimate of the accretion rate in this system.

In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.","published":"2025-09-11T13:01:45Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.HE"]}

This includes the first tentative detection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first tentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for the first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest velocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features occasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly indicate vibrational pumping by $\\approx$10 $\\mu$m photons, which must be abundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\\approx$300 K) of the ammonia emitting gas.

The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.","published":"2025-01-13T09:25:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at $0\\lesssim z\\lesssim 12$ -- primarily discovered with JWST -- to those observed in local globular clusters. We find striking similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments -- similar to those traced by NOEGs -- that were self-enriched.

We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z>3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation.

This sample is comprised of 90 NIR spectra of 48 transient events, spanning from hours after explosion to $\\geq + 350$ days. Acquired over three years (2021-2024), this data release includes 17 Type Ia SNe, 15 Type II SNe, 8 Stripped Envelope SNe, 6 interacting SNe, 1 TDE, and 1 SLSN-I. These spectra were all systematically reduced using either the \\textsc{Python}-based reduction code \\textsc{Pypeit} or the \\textsc{IDL}-based \\textsc{Spextool} and constitute one of the largest NIR samples of transients available to the astrophysical community. We show the utility of NIR spectra and identify the key spectral features across multiple types of SNe. We show how both early-time and nebular-phase NIR spectra can be used to investigate the physics of the explosion, and to reveal the properties of the progenitor. With the addition of this dataset, the number of publicly available NIR spectra spanning multiple transient types has been substantially increased. In its next phase, \\textit{HISS} will leverage target-of-opportunity spectral observations and NIR imaging from telescopes on Maunakea. Expanding the NIR dataset of SNe is vital to the transient community, particularly in light of the increasing emphasis on the infrared regime following the recent launch of the \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} and the forthcoming launch of the \\textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope}.","published":"2025-05-24T05:06:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

This field-level inference yields physically consistent realizations of cosmic structure, leveraging a nonlinear gravitational solver, a refined galaxy bias model, and physics-informed priors. The Manticore-Local posterior realizations evolve within a parent cosmological volume statistically consistent with LCDM, demonstrated through extensive posterior predictive tests of power spectra, bispectra, initial condition Gaussianity, and the halo mass function. The inferred local supervolume shows no significant deviation from cosmological expectations; notably, we find no evidence for a large local underdensity. Our model identifies high-significance counterparts for fourteen prominent galaxy clusters each within one degree of its observed sky position. Across the posterior ensemble, these counterparts are consistently detected with 2-4 sigma significance, and their reconstructed masses and redshifts agree closely with observational estimates, confirming the inference's spatial and dynamical fidelity. The peculiar velocity field recovered by Manticore-Local achieves the highest Bayesian evidence across five datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Unlike methods yielding only point estimates or using simplified dynamics, Manticore-Local provides a full Bayesian posterior over cosmic structure and evolution, enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification. These results establish Manticore-Local as the most advanced constrained realization suite of the Local Universe to date, offering a robust statistical foundation for future studies of galaxy formation, velocity flows, and environmental dependencies in our cosmic neighbourhood.","published":"2025-05-15T19:59:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

To address these challenges, we propose the development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases, understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data analysis.

In particular, in the PeV energy range, the combination of IceTop and IceCube's deep optical detector provides excellent gamma-hadron separation. Almost all air showers induced by cosmic-ray protons and heavier nuclei in this energy range contain high-energy muons detectable by the deep detector, while most photon-induced air showers do not. Therefore, IceCube's deep detector can be used to strongly suppress hadronic background in photon searches. Furthermore, the lateral distribution of the air-shower signal in IceTop provides additional gamma-hadron separation. In the PeV energy range, the gamma-hadron separation achieved is better than $10^{-3}$: air-shower events measured with IceCube are suppressed more than 1000 times stronger than photon-induced showers of the same energy simulated with Sibyll 2.3d.

Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, together with other planned instrumental upgrades, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to a few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.","published":"2025-09-08T16:09:42Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM","gr-qc"]}

Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and star formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting with CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as star-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR), adopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using the 1\/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions. Results. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and agree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic mass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*\/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that of star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming galaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent fraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at log(M*\/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an excess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3 stellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the literature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models. Quiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9, but 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including 7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more accurate SED fitting and galaxy classification.","published":"2025-09-03T15:29:08Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the outputs of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6 M_\\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved in the antineutrino sector between $\\bar\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_x = (\\bar\\nu_\\mu + \\bar\\nu_\\tau)\/2$ for both post-bounce times.

Average flows are created by these inflows combined, and the strength of these flows depends on the amount of flux present during the solar cycle. In models of the solar cycle, this average flow can be depicted as perturbations to the meridional flow. In this article, we study the effects of introducing surface inflow to the surface flux transport models (SFT) as a possible nonlinear mechanism in the presence of latitude quenching for an inflow profile whose amplitude varies within a cycle depending on the magnetic activity. The results show that including surface inflows in the model in the presence of both LQ and tilt quenching (TQ) produced a polar field within a $\\pm$1$\\sigma$ of an average cycle polar field ($\\sigma$ is the standard deviation) and a correlation coefficient of 0.85. We confirm that including inflows produces a lower net contribution to the dipole moment (10\\,--\\,25\\%). Furthermore, the relative importance of LQ vs. inflows is inversely correlated with the dynamo effectivity range ($\\lambda_{R}$). With no decay term, introducing inflows into the model resulted in a less significant net contribution to the dipole moment. Including inflows in the SFT model shows a possible nonlinear relationship between the surface inflows and the solar dipole moment, suggesting a potential nonlinear mechanism contributing to the saturation of the global dynamo. For lower $\\lambda_R$ ($\\lessapprox$ 10 $^\\circ$), TQ always dominates LQ, and for higher $\\lambda_R$ LQ dominate. However, including inflows will make the domination a little bit earlier in case of having a decay term in the model.","published":"2025-04-04T09:08:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.comp-ph","physics.data-an"]}

The dust size (~0.8 micron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST\/MIRI are only ~60% of those obtained by Spitzer\/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.","published":"2025-01-10T12:15:39Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO\/AIA instrument data.","published":"2025-09-06T06:58:38Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.IM"]}

This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies.

One central question for analyses of SNe Ia is whether the remaining diversity of standardized luminosities arises in part from an intrinsic or extrinsic effect; characterized by the color-independent bimodality in progenitor population or color- and host- dependent diversity in dust extinction, respectively. In the initial analyses of the volume-limited subset (z < 0.06; 945 SNe) of this sample from the ZTF collaboration, the authors reported evidences for the former hypothesis, in contrast to many of the previous evidences for the dust hypothesis found across other largest high- and low- redshift SNe Ia samples. We re-analyze the volume-limited ZTF SNe Ia in the same manner that previous samples were analyzed and report consistency with trends seen in literature samples and in support of the dust hypothesis. We find the following: 1. a color dependency in the canonical `mass-step' size for SNe, with red SNe having a larger host-dependent residual step than blue SNe by 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.09 mag; 2. a color-dependent difference in the Hubble residual scatter, with red SNe having a $\\sim$ 33% larger scatter than blue SNe at > 3$\\sigma$ significance; 3. data's preference of a model that accounts for color-dependency over a simple `step' model at $\\sim$ 3$\\sigma$; 4. the strongest evidence to date (3.5$\\sigma$) that the relationship between SN color, host-galaxy properties, and luminosity is continuous rather than characterized by a discrete step.

In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson system.","published":"2025-05-14T05:41:57Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.CO","hep-ph"]}

These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this work, we study how oscillations of the form $\\lim_{q\\ll k}B(q,k)\\propto \\cos(\\mu \\ln(q\/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively erasing the signal on scales $k \\gtrsim 0.3~h\/{\\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$. This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum is suppressed by a factor of $(q\/k)^{3\/2}$ relative to the template studied here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.","published":"2025-05-19T17:59:23Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc","hep-ph"]}

This possibly undifferentiated state contrasts sharply with the globally molten state inferred in its counterpart, Ganymede, and poses unique challenges to theories of the formation and evolution of the Galilean moons. During their formation, both moons experienced multiple heating mechanisms, including tidal heating, radiogenic heating from short-lived radionuclides, accretional heating from impacts, and heat from the surrounding circumplanetary disk. Our study investigates the optimal conditions required to account for Callisto's partially differentiated state in contrast to Ganymede's complete differentiation. We investigate crucial accretion parameters, such as the timing of accretion onset, the duration of accretion, and the impactor size distribution. We find that the observed dichotomy between Ganymede and Callisto can be attributed to similar formation conditions, assuming an identical impactor size distribution and composition in the Jovian circumplanetary disk. The key differences in the formation of Ganymede and Callisto are the disk temperature at their respective formation locations and their final radii. Our results indicate that both moons accreted gradually over more than 2 Myr, concluding at least 5.5 Myr after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions in the protosolar nebula. Our model demonstrates that Callisto can remain undifferentiated despite accreting a substantial influx of kilometer-sized impactors, potentially contributing up to 30% of the total mass inflow, while still allowing for the complete differentiation of Ganymede.","published":"2025-05-12T17:38:09Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

With its remarkable 0.281 square degree field of view and diffraction-limited angular resolution of ~0.1 arcsec, Roman is uniquely suited to characterizing dark matter substructure from a robust population of strong lenses. We present a yield simulation of detectable strong lenses in Roman's planned High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS).

We analyse models from the STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements, unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However, observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference and the length of the embedded phase.","published":"2025-05-30T21:15:55Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"]}

Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \\lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking.

If true, the suggestion of SNR 0509-67.5 being an SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.","published":"2025-03-06T18:56:47Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.","published":"2025-01-06T15:04:42Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.space-ph"]}

In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate the stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial velocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire sample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of these parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that stars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of rotational velocities, from values consistent with no\/slow rotation up to $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km\/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities appears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in this cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ and the color of the eMSTO stars, with $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes redder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars strongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC 1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild spectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting that they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on. Interestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars are slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose that the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster age.","published":"2025-04-11T08:55:31Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \\begin{align*} \\bar{a}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-8\\pi R_{\\mathrm{m}}^2\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)}}, \\end{align*} where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.","published":"2025-03-04T06:22:26Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.HE","hep-th"]}

In this work, based on a two-component Bayesian model, we examine how $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ affects the radio emission from quasars, separating the contributions from host galaxy star formation (SF) and AGN activity. By modelling the radio flux density distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. The same holds for AGN activity across most $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ values; however, quasars with the top 20\\% most massive SMBHs are 2 to 3 times more likely to host strong radio jets than those with lower-mass SMBHs at similar redshift and luminosity.

Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star.","published":"2025-05-15T14:15:24Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc","nucl-th"]}

Reverberation mapping assumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive variability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags between X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent reverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as weakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and evidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how X-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform 3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray reprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated opacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation. We find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray irradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the reprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed, although linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray reprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock lags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing. Finally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by a factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the discrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.","published":"2025-01-10T19:03:29Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.","published":"2025-05-20T07:25:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

These time-dependent phenomena also complicate the remote characterization of exoplanets by altering the abundance of key chemical species and modulating atmospheric brightness temperatures. While prior studies have largely focused on photochemical effects, surface UV dosages, and spectral consequences, here we extend the analysis using three-dimensional general circulation models coupled with interactive photochemistry. We simulate the climate and chemical responses of TRAPPIST-1e-like, synchronously rotating planets subjected to stellar energetic particle events and periodic UV flux enhancements. Using statistical methods, we evaluate impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results show that abrupt thermospheric cooling occurs via radiative emissions from NO and CO2, while warming in the middle and lower atmosphere arises from increased infrared absorbers, including N2O and H2O. In moderately active stellar regimes, atmospheric temperature changes are strongly modulated by O3 variability. Cumulative effects depend on flare frequency, while instantaneous responses are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution of the flare. Notably, intense flares can dynamically energize the middle atmosphere, enhancing wind speeds by up to 40 m\/s on the substellar nightside at altitudes of 30 to 50 km. These findings suggest that repeated, high-energy eruptive events from young stars may play a critical role in shaping atmospheric dynamics on temperate terrestrial exoplanets.","published":"2025-05-06T17:51:42Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Their cooling rates critically impact both detectability and age estimates in close binaries. Compared to He WDs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly different mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary behavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes the cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation point in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE stellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to 0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling track. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool rapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where hydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling. Minimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective temperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million years at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In contrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying cooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong the pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The value of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing systematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs. Our results show that CE He WDs follow distinct evolutionary paths, with important implications for interpreting the nature and fate of compact binaries hosting He WDs.","published":"2025-06-05T22:12:07Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

If many studies were recently dedicated to the last stages of BBH where black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk (CBD), the structure of these systems prior to the formation of the CBD remains mostly unexplored. The aim of the present article is to investigate the potential modifications induced by the presence of a secondary black hole onto the structure of the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole. We performed 2D classical hydrodynamical simulations of an accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole while taking into account all gravitational effects induced by both the primary black hole and the secondary black hole orbiting on circular orbits around the center of mass of the system.We report three main effects of the presence of a secondary black hole orbiting a circular orbit beyond the outer edge of the accretion disk: 1\/ the outer radius of the accretion disk is significantly reduced and its ratio to the black hole separation is directly linked to only the mass ratio of the black holes; 2\/ two spiral arms are visible in the gas density structure of the disk and 3\/ the outer edge of the accretion disk exhibits an elliptical shape that mainly depends on the mass ratio of the black holes. Our results show that an accretion disk orbiting a primary black hole in a pre-CBD BBH exhibits specific features induced by the gravitational force generated by the presence of a secondary black hole beyond its outer edge. Such features, directly linked to the binary separation and mass ratio, has therefore the potential to help in the search and identification of BBH in the pre-CBD stage.","published":"2025-04-10T15:55:18Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"]}

Their most widely accepted formation channels involve binary evolution and progenitors near the tip of the red giant branch, thus studying these objects improves our knowledge of complicated astrophysical processes such as common envelope evolution and the helium flash. In this work, we compare the observed sdB population with a synthetic Galactic population generated through the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, which allows us to estimate the physical properties of the current-day Galactic sdB population. We show that our synthetic sdB population matches the general properties of the observations quite well in the Kiel diagram when either a normal or lognormal distribution is assumed for the assignment of hydrogen-rich envelope masses. We also find that the canonical mass assumption should only be confidently assumed for specific system configurations and that the estimated number of sdBs found within 500 pc of the Sun in our model is at least four times higher than the observational one. We recover the observational P-q relation for sdBs plus main-sequence companions, while a similar relation between sdBs and helium white dwarf companions is rather complicated. We conclude that a better understanding of hydrogen-rich envelopes is needed, as well as an observational characterization of the sdB plus main-sequence companions earlier than spectral type $~$F. These issues aside, atmospheric properties, companion types, period, and mass distributions are in good agreement with observational and theoretical studies available in the literature.","published":"2025-05-09T05:17:44Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.","published":"2025-03-01T07:02:24Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

This relationship suggests these scenarios can be tested by predicting biosignature distributions and comparing them with empirical data. Here, we demonstrate this approach by focusing on the cyanosulfidic origins-of-life scenario and investigating the hypothesis that a minimum near-ultraviolet (NUV) flux is necessary for abiogenesis. Using Bayesian modeling and the \\bioverse\\ survey simulator, we constrain the probability of obtaining strong evidence for or against this ``UV Threshold Hypothesis'' with future biosignature surveys.   Our results indicate that a correlation between past NUV flux and current biosignature occurrence is testable for sample sizes of $\\gtrsim$50 planets. The diagnostic power of such tests is critically sensitive to the intrinsic abiogenesis rate and host star properties, particularly maximum past NUV fluxes. Surveys targeting a wide range of fluxes, and planets orbiting M dwarfs enhance the chances of conclusive results, with sample sizes $\\gtrsim$100 providing $\\gtrsim$80\\% likelihood of strong evidence if abiogenesis rates are high and the required NUV fluxes are moderate. For required fluxes exceeding a few hundred erg\/s\/cm$^2$, both the fraction of inhabited planets and the diagnostic power sharply decrease.   Our findings demonstrate the potential of exoplanet surveys to test origins-of-life hypotheses. Beyond specific scenarios, this work underscores the broader value of realistic survey simulations for future observatories (e.g., HWO, LIFE, ELTs, Nautilus) in identifying testable science questions, optimizing mission strategies, and advancing theoretical and experimental studies of abiogenesis.","published":"2025-04-05T19:41:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

As this airglow can even outshine scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime, the understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge of the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. As airglow modelling is very challenging, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow emission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this can be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with a wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal sampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 $\\mu$m and additional data from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded to build a comprehensive spectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site under consideration of theoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different sources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE) model comprises 9 chemical species, 26,541 emission lines, and 3 unresolved continuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity, solar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day of year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a stand-alone code for different conditions, also including optional atmospheric absorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra, PALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the previous, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal.","published":"2025-04-14T20:12:50Z","categories":["physics.ao-ph","astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

Recent hydrodynamic simulations have predicted the nucleosynthetic yields for both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white-dwarf models, but without accounting for thermonuclear reaction-rate uncertainties. We perform detailed Monte Carlo post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear reaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation. We quantify the resulting abundance uncertainties and identify the key nuclear reactions that dominate them. Our results show that both the CO and ONe nova models robustly produce characteristic CNO isotopes. More pronounced abundance differences emerge for elements with A $\\ge$ 20. Sulfur is the most robust observational discriminator between the CO and ONe nova models, with a model-to-model difference of a factor of $\\approx$30 and minimal sensitivity to reaction rate uncertainties. Neon, silicon, and phosphorus exhibit even larger abundance differences (factors of $\\approx$150-250), providing strong diagnostic potential. While their predicted yields are subject to larger uncertainties, these remain smaller than the model-to-model differences, allowing these elements to serve as useful, though less precise, tracers of white-dwarf composition. Chlorine, argon, and potassium also differ between models, but the 1$\\sigma$-abundance ranges for the CO and ONe models overlap, reducing their present usefulness as composition tracers. We find that only nine nuclear reactions dominate the abundance uncertainties of the most diagnostically important isotopes, and their influence is largely independent of the underlying white-dwarf composition.

Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect.

When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\\eta_{\\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V<-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\\lesssim\\eta_{\\rm max}\\lesssim 2000$.

Unlike previous approaches, which are typically biased toward bright, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), our method uncovers fainter systems with lower magnifications. This enables the identification and individual study of lensing events that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing analyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range $1.2 < z < 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular distance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors ($0.5 < \\mathrm{W2} - \\mathrm{W3} < 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of elliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\\mathrm{W1}$ color and photometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative selection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with CIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical properties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the lensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to constrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared luminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated magnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing regime ($\\mu \\simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise modeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential candidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations will be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further investigate their physical properties.","published":"2025-09-09T23:13:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

In this work, within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars to systematically investigate the spin of the second-born black hole and its role in shaping this correlation. Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a recently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential rotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch wind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we perform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion. Our results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is insensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interactions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the dominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning black holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital synchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the second-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes in GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff-can be reproduced. We further show that the q-chi_eff correlation is sensitive to the assumed mass function (e.g., Gaussian and uniform distribution), displaying notable deviations from the Power-Law+Peak model.","published":"2025-09-07T08:43:19Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.SR","gr-qc"]}

In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude.

A thorough analysis of radial migration considering these two gravitational regimes might shed some light on different predictions of DM and MOND theories. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the effects of resonances and stellar radial migration (churning) in a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy in the DM and MOND regimes. We performed simulations of a MW-like galaxy to analyse the effect of non-axisymmetric structures (galactic bar and spiral arms) considering various parameters of the spiral structure.

However, many of these objects are hidden behind large columns of gas and dust at the center of galaxies and are difficult to detect. The X-ray and UV emission in these systems are predicted to vary regularly on timescales comparable to that of the orbital period of the binary. This is the first of a series of papers where we aim to find SMBHB candidates based on quasi-periodic light curves from the soft X-ray instrument eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory and X-ray follow-up. We searched the multi-epoch SRG\/eROSITA all-sky surveys for extragalactic sources that show an `up-down-up-down' or `down-up-down-up' profile (from scan to scan) in their 0.2--2.3 keV flux light curves. We compiled a sample of 16 sources that are suitable for X-ray follow-up campaigns given their brightness and significant variability between bright and faint SRG\/eROSITA flux levels. We triggered extensive Swift-XRT and NICER monitoring campaigns on the best SMBHB candidates to confirm or discard their tentative periodicities. Optical spectroscopic observations confirmed the nuclear and extragalactic nature of 15\/16 objects and enabled single-epoch SMBH mass measurements and BPT classifications. Our most promising candidate, eRASSt J0530-4125, shows X-ray quasi-periodic variability with a typical time scale of one year in the observed frame. By stacking the X-ray observations of each source in our sample, we find that 14\/15 sources can be modeled by a power law with a photon index ranging from $\\Gamma\\sim1.8-2.8$. Based on our selection, we estimate an optimistic upper limit on the fraction of SMBHB candidates to be $\\sim 0.05$ per galaxy. We emphasize that further observational evidence is needed to confirm the SMBHB nature of our sources.","published":"2025-05-05T15:06:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.","published":"2025-06-04T12:30:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.HE"]}

Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course, after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142 system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with observations.","published":"2025-05-19T15:23:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

It is observed to evolve with redshift in unresolved galaxies up to z>6. However, observational constraints limits our view at such early epochs to galaxies with M_* >= 10^7 M_Sun. On the other hand, in the local Universe the MZR can be traced down to the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function (M_*= 10^2 M_Sun) but we have access only to its present-day realization. We propose to use RR Lyrae stars to get the mean metallicity of local dwarf galaxies at the early epoch in which these variable stars were formed (z>~3), opening a new window on the evolution of the MZR across cosmic times down to the lowest mass. We use available data for a sample of Milky Way satellites to show that indeed the evolution of the MZR from the epoch of the formation of RR Lyrae to the present day can be traced with this approach, with results broadly compatible with those inferred from high z galaxies from nebular emission lines. The limitations of the approach as well as possible ways to refine the analysis are also briefly discussed.","published":"2025-03-06T19:54:55Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Incorporating these stars will help tighten the RRd PLR and improve distance measurements.

All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.","published":"2025-09-03T16:43:36Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest OCs as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old OCs with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease in metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\\pm$0.004 dex\/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\\pm$0.056 dex\/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\\pm$0.030 dex\/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is nicely explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed.

While four bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority (> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate, depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful. This work also hints at the requirement for stable configurations for particular size domains in order to explain DIB wavelength stability.","published":"2025-05-19T14:58:41Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","quant-ph"]}

Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra.

Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae.

Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM.

We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles.

By generating mock light curves for a broad range of possible mergers and with a variety of ejecta models, and then performing parameter estimation with different ejecta models, we measure how reliably and consistently we can use the 'map' between intrinsic and outflow properties provided by the formulae to gain source (intrinsic) information from purely electromagnetic detections (observables). We find that the posteriors probability densities are prone to biases when we vary the choice of reference model for our sampler, especially away from the best studied region of the binary parameter space, i.e. near equal mass, low mass binaries. This highlights both the need for improved models for the mass of the ejecta, and the need to exert caution when performing parameter estimation with a single mass model. We also find that most models predict that parameter degeneracies in kilonova light curves are largely orthogonal to those measurement observables, such as the chirp mass, from gravitational wave signals, indicating that kilonovae may provide a lot of additional information even in multi-messenger observations, if better modeled.","published":"2025-04-04T19:42:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.   Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.   The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of \"escaper\" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.","published":"2025-01-10T15:16:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.","published":"2025-10-07T14:12:40Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA"]}

This study explores the feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron (MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition, it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary exosphere models.

To fully exploit joint GW and electromagnetic (EM) detections, dedicated strategies and adapted EM facilities are essential. We investigate the role of Integral Field and Multi-Object Spectroscopy (IFS and MOS) with the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) on next generation GW multi-messenger (MM) observations. We consider simulations of BNS populations, their GW detections with ET(+CE), and their EM counterparts: kilonovae (KNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We consider two strategies: one in synergy with wide-field photometric surveys, and a galaxy-targeted one exploiting WST high multiplexing. We estimate the number of galaxies in GW error volumes, and identify observational challenges and mitigation strategies. We find that WST can detect KNe up to $z\\sim0.4$ and $m_{\\mathrm{AB}}\\sim25$, and GRB afterglows beyond $z>1$ for $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{view}}\\lesssim15^\\circ$. KN observations are best scheduled 12-24 hours post-merger. For poorly localised GRBs, WST IFS can aid the identification.

For this work, we utilize data from the Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE Survey (C3VO) along with extensive spectroscopic and photometric datasets available for the COSMOS field, including the HST-Hyperion Survey. To evaluate potential merger and interaction activity, we measure the fraction of galaxies with close kinematic companions ($f_{ckc}$) both within Hyperion and the coeval field by means of a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology developed in this work that probabilistically employs our entire combined spectroscopic and photometric dataset. We validate our $f_{ckc}$ MC methodology on a simulated lightcone built from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semi-analytic model, and we determine correction factors that account for the underlying spectroscopic sampling rate of our dataset. We find that galaxies in Hyperion have close kinematic companions $\\gtrsim 2\\times$ more than galaxies in the field and measure a corrected $f_{ckc}=49_{-7.8}^{+7.4}$% for Hyperion and a corrected $f_{ckc}=23_{-1.3}^{+1.2}$% for the surrounding field; a $>3\\sigma$ difference. This increase in $f_{ckc}$ indicates an enhancement in the merger and interaction activity within Hyperion and matches the trend seen in other structures. The rate of merger and interactions within the field implied from our field $f_{ckc}$ measurement is well aligned with values measured from other observations in similar redshift ranges.

Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp.

We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to the formation of quasi-satellite orbits. We systematically investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the entire lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification methodology for identifying all co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the entire lunar surface with velocities ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be a common outcome, with approximately 6.15% of all simulated particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% specifically exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2 times escape velocity) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency at this specific velocity. The spatial distribution of successful ejections shows a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or the Moon occur for only 4% of the sample. Our results strengthen the plausibility of lunar origin for Earth's co-orbital bodies, including quasi-satellites like Kamo'oalewa and 2024 PT5.

Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.","published":"2025-06-03T19:27:47Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.CO","hep-th"]}

The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees.

We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits.

It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index <0.85 (assuming the Ha\/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z < 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (< 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun. Deep VLT\/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line.

The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius, if it is initially shallower than $r^{-1}$. This is fundamentally a consequence of the virial theorem: self-gravitating systems have a negative specific heat and want to cool down when energized. The inner halo relaxes to an $r^{-1}$ cusp because its central region is the coldest among all $r^{-\\gamma}$ profiles with $0\\leq \\gamma \\leq 2$. Accretion and relaxation in the $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ outer fall-off, thereby establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile.

The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG\/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0<z<5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)>6.5x10^-15 erg\/s\/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of >2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS\/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.","published":"2025-05-06T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

These features are likely linked to solar wind heating and acceleration. During PSP Encounter 17 (at $11.4R_s$) on Sep-26-2023, the PSP\/FIELDS instrument detected enhanced ion-scale wave activity associated with deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium in ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) observed by the PSP\/Solar Probe Analyzers-Ion (SPAN-I). Dense beams (secondary populations) were present in the proton VDFs during this wave activity. Using bi-Maxwellian fits to the proton VDFs, we found that the density of the proton beam population increased during the wave activity and, unexpectedly, surpassed the core population at certain intervals. Interestingly, the wave power was reduced during the intervals when the beam population density exceeded the core density. The drift velocity of the beams decreases from 0.9 to 0.7 of the Alfv\\'{e}n speed and the proton core shows a higher temperature anisotropy ($T_\\perp\/T_\\parallel>2.5$) during these intervals. We conclude that the observations during these intervals are consistent with a reconnection event during a heliospheric current sheet crossing. During this event, $\\alpha$ particle parameters (density, velocity, and temperature anisotropy) remained nearly constant. Using linear analysis, we examined how the proton beam drives instability or wave dissipation. Furthermore, We investigated the nonlinear evolution of ion kinetic instabilities using hybrid kinetic simulations.

A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\\sim$0.1-0.2. Furthermore, the spins in the first-born black holes appear lower than in the second-born ones. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high, $a_*\\gtrsim 0.7$. This is the case, in particular, for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0, while their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion, but only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, we find the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into the incident and reflected ones, which is intrinsically highly uncertain. The method of spectral fitting accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models give the disk temperatures higher than the standard models, and consequently predict lower spins. We postulate that the published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. We hypothesize that the spins of the binaries with high-mass donors are low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high, including high spins as required to power relativistic jets.","published":"2025-05-31T16:24:15Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

Computational challenges have hindered a comprehensive 3D exploration of this interplay, posing a longstanding challenge in our understanding of clouds and cores. Our objective was to study the spatial features and time evolution of the neutral-ion drift velocity and the mass-to-flux ratio in a 3D nonideal MHD chemo-dynamical simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. The resistivities of the cloud were computed self-consistently from a vast non-equilibrium chemical network containing 115 species. To compute the resistivities we used different mean collisional rates for each charged species in our network. We additionally developed a new generalized method for measuring the true mass-to-flux ratio in 3D simulations. Despite the cloud's turbulent nature, at early times, the neutral-ion drift velocity follows the expected structure from 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with an hourglass magnetic field. At later times, however, the neutral-ion drift velocity becomes increasingly complex, with many vectors pointing outward from the cloud's center. Specifically, we find that the drift velocity above and below the cloud's ``midplane'' is in ``antiphase''. We explain these features on the basis of magnetic helical loops and the correlation of the drift velocity with the magnetic tension force per unit volume. Despite the complex structure of the neutral-ion drift velocity, we demonstrate that, when averaged over a region, the true mass-to-flux ratio monotonically increases as a function of time and decreases as a function of the radius from the center of the cloud. In contrast, the ``observed'' mass-to-flux ratio shows poor correlation with the true mass-to-flux ratio and the density structure of the cloud.","published":"2025-05-26T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement.

These measurements are consistent with an absence of atmosphere. Previous 1D atmospheric modeling also excludes -- at first sight -- CO2-rich atmospheres. However, only a subset of the possible atmosphere types has been explored and ruled out to date. Recently, a full thermal phase curve of the planet at 15 microns with JWST has also been observed, allowing for more information on the thermal structure of the planet.   We first looked for atmospheres capable of producing a dayside emission compatible with secondary eclipse observations. We then tried to determine which of these are compatible with the observed thermal phase curve.   We used a 1D radiative-convective model and a 3D global climate model (GCM) to simulate a wide range of atmospheric compositions and surface pressures. We then produced observables from these simulations and compared them to available emission observations.   We found several families of atmospheres compatible at 2-sigma with the eclipse observations. Among them, some feature a flat phase curve and can be ruled out with the observation, and some produce a phase curve still compatible with the data (i.e., thin N2-CO2 atmospheres, and CO2 atmospheres rich in hazes). We also highlight different 3D effects that could not be predicted from 1D studies (redistribution efficiency, atmospheric collapse).   The available observations of TRAPPIST-1 b are consistent with an airless planet, which is the most likely scenario. A second possibility is a thin CO2-poor residual atmosphere. However, our study shows that different atmospheric scenarios can result in a high eclipse depth at 15 microns. It may therefore be hazardous, in general, to conclude on the presence of an atmosphere from a single photometric point.","published":"2025-09-02T09:16:33Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.","published":"2025-01-06T17:48:47Z","categories":["physics.space-ph","astro-ph.EP","physics.geo-ph"]}

We aim to study the diversity of metallicity profiles that can arise in the current cosmological context and compare them with available observations. We also seek to identify the physical processes responsible for breaks in metallicity profiles by using two galaxies as case studies. We analyze central galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the CIELO project, within the stellar mass range [$10^{8.5}$, $10^{10.5}$] M$_\\odot$ at $z=0$. A new algorithm, DB-A, was developed to fit multiple power laws to the metallicity profiles, enabling a flexible assessment of metallicity gradients in various galactic regions.

A temporal analysis of Local Group analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with outer breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability at high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner breaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star formation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven outflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material, extended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at high redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows.

Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to {\\Lambda}CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.","published":"2025-01-07T12:45:19Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Adopting a Schechter distribution, f(z,W)dW = Phi* (W\/W*)^alpha e^{-W\/W*} dW\/W*, we present the normalization, Phi*(z), the characteristic equivalent width, W*(z), and the weak-end slope, alpha(z), as smooth functions of redshift. Measurements of dN\/dX are robust for z < 4 but less so at z > 4 for weaker absorbers (Wr < 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven scenarios: from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4, dN\/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2) decreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show that in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of weak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is such that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of scenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z > 4. Our results provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution spanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into galactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z > 5 MgII surveys and have implications for detectability of a MgII forest at z > 7.","published":"2025-10-01T20:10:34Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA"]}

High spectral resolving power allows for the efficient removal of telluric and host-star contamination. Combined with the large collecting area of ground-based telescopes it enables detailed studies of atmospheric species, temperature structure, atmospheric loss, and global winds and circulation patterns. In this review, the wide range of HRS observation and data-analysis techniques are described and literature results discussed. Key findings include:   * The highest irradiated planets show a rich spectrum of atomic and ionic species, just like stars.   * Retrieval analyses of Hot Jupiters and directly imaged Super- Jupiters point to Solar metallicities and chemistry, but observed samples are still heterogeneous and incomplete.   * There appears to be a clear dichotomy between Hot Jupiters with and without atmospheric inversions, depending on their equilibrium temperature.   * Some highly irradiated planets exhibit enormous leading and\/or trailing tails of helium gas, providing unique insights into planet evolution and atmospheric escape processes.   * Minor isotopes of carbon and oxygen are now being detected in gas giant planets and brown dwarfs with the interesting potential to shed light on formation pathways.   A list of potential pitfalls is provided for those new to the field, and synergies with JWST are discussed. HRS has a great future ahead with the advent of the extremely large telescopes, promising to bring temperate rocky exoplanets into view with their increase in HRS detection speed of up to three orders of magnitude.","published":"2025-05-13T19:50:47Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

However, no significant features were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits our ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA data, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit only briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over long-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed Sgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream throughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a relatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter distances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more consistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or the Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is also distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the GSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong connection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential association with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream. Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.","published":"2025-06-05T09:33:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"]}

Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST.

We also show that FRB 20190417A is spatially coincident with a compact, luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse physical size of the PRS to < 23.1 pc and yields an integrated flux density of 191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM evolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging between +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad\/m2 over three years.

Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.","published":"2025-05-05T18:00:23Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

The Habitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the possibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in development to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of spectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter. This initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED fitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used by the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that the GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta parameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation age of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate the 2175\\r{A} attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same feature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness of HWO's ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a FUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted.

Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C\/O enhancement with disk age.

In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that, for a PBH abundance $\\Omega_\\text{PBH}\/\\Omega_\\text{DM} = 0.01$, this mechanism naturally produces a population of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of $\\mathcal{O}(0.3)$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. Notably, most mergers arise in low-mass galaxies, making the latter rate sensitive to the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function. The dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.","published":"2025-05-08T18:00:04Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.CO"]}

Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation\/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe -- in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.","published":"2025-10-07T18:08:37Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

In a static axisymmetric system, these quantities are (reasonable approximations of) the integrals of motion of an orbit. However, in a galaxy like the Milky Way with a triaxial, rotating bar, none of these quantities are conserved, and the only known integral is the Jacobi energy $E_J$. This may result in chaotic orbits, especially for inner halo stars. Here, we investigate the bar's effect on the dynamics of nearby halo stars, and more specifically its impact on their distribution in $(E, L_z, L_{\\bot})$ space. To this end, we have integrated and characterised the orbits of halo stars located within 1 kpc from the Sun. We computed their orbital frequencies and quantified the degree of chaoticity and associated timescales, using the Lyapunov exponent and the frequency diffusion rate. We find that the bar introduces a large degree of chaoticity on the stars in our sample: more than half are found to be on chaotic orbits, and this fraction is highest for stars on very bound and\/or radial orbits. Such stars wander in $(E, L_z, L_{\\bot})$ space on timescales shorter than a Hubble time. This introduces some overlap and hence contamination amongst previously identified accreted substructures with these orbital characteristics, although our assessment is that this is relatively limited. The bar also induces a number of resonances in the stellar halo, which are of larger importance for lower inclination, prograde orbits. Because the effect of the Galactic bar on the local halo is important for stars on very bound and\/or radial orbits, clustering analyses in these regions should be conducted with care. Replacing the energy by $E_J$ in such analyses could be an improvement.","published":"2025-05-26T15:45:28Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

For the hard state, we examine compact and extended corona models. We find that compact corona models are energetically favored, but extended models cannot be fully excluded. We discuss the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet. We propose the presence of a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk moving at approximately half the speed of light away from the disk for both the soft and the hard state. In the soft state, the pairs cool to the Compton temperature of the disk emission. In the hard state, the pairs acquire thermal and bulk motion allowing them to Comptonize the emission to produce the observed power law emission. In both emission states, the bulk motion away from the disk leads to a net polarization parallel to the radio jet.

For X-ray binaries with neutron stars, with the help of precise measurements of the spin periods provided by current instrumentation, these models render a way to infer such parameters as the strength of the dipolar field and a distance to the system. Often, the obtained magnetic field strength values contradict those from other methods used to obtain magnetic field estimates.   Aims.

After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.   Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO\/Virgo\/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA).

The LiteBIRD single-stage SQUID Array is required to have high transimpedance amplification while maintaining a low input inductance and low dynamic resistance. In addition, the input-referred current noise must be very low, and the power dissipation must remain below about 100 nW. These requirements have non-trivial interactions. To maximize performance within these requirements we have performed lumped-element SQUID simulation. We find that by optimizing SQUID internal damping elements and inductive loading, good single-stage SQUID array performance can be obtained for LiteBIRD, including significant engineering margin.","published":"2025-01-09T21:54:26Z","categories":["physics.ins-det","astro-ph.IM"]}

From this cross-match we selected 45 new high-$z$ radio quasar candidates with S$_{888MHz}>1$ mJy and mag$z<21.3$ over an area of 16000deg$^2$. Using spectroscopic observations, we confirmed the high-$z$ nature of 24 new quasars, 13 at $4.5<z<5$ and 11 at $z>5$.

Based on observations of Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) at soft X-ray (SXR) wavelength and the daily sunspot numbers (DSNs) since 1975, we obtained some interesting and heuristic conclusions: (1) Both S-flares and the more powerful extremely strong flares (ES-flares, >X14.3) mostly occur in the late phases of solar cycles and low-latitude regions on the solar disk; (2) Similar to X-class flares, the occurrence of S-flares in each solar cycle is somewhat random, but the occurrence of ES-flares seems to be dominated by the mean DSN (Vm) and its root-mean-square deviation during the valley phase (Vd) before the cycle: the ES-flare number is strongly correlated with Vd, and the occurrence time of the first ES-flare is anti-correlated with Vd and Vm. These facts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the more the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred. We proposed that the Sun may have a low-latitude active zone (LAZ), and most ES-flares are generated from the interaction between LAZ and the newly emerging active regions. The correlations and the linear regression functions may provide an useful method to predict the occurrence of ES-flares in an upcoming solar cycle, which derives that solar cycle 25 will have about 2 ES-flares after the spring of 2027.","published":"2025-01-07T13:55:24Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

Both space-based and ground-based observations have shown that many exoplanets likely also contain photochemically-generated hazes. Haze particles are a key source of organic matter and may impact the evolution or origin of life. In addition, haze layers could provide a mechanism for lower-atmospheric shielding and ultimately atmospheric retention. Often orbiting close to M-dwarf stars, these planets receive large amounts of radiation, especially during flaring events, which may strip away their atmospheres. M-dwarf stars are known to have higher stellar activity than other types of stars, and stellar flares have the potential to accelerate atmospheric escape. In this work, we present results on laboratory investigations of UV radiation effects simulating two different stellar flare energies on laboratory-produced exoplanet hazes made under conditions analogous to water-world atmospheres. We find that both simulated flares altered the overall transmittance and reflectance of the hazes, and higher energy \"flares\" make those alterations more pronounced. On a larger scale, these laboratory-made hazes show potential signs of degradation over the simulated flaring period. Our results provide insight into the effects that stellar flaring events have on potential exoplanet haze composition and the ability for water-world-like exoplanets to retain their atmospheres.","published":"2025-05-19T19:51:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max \/ v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1\/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1\/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1\/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2\/3.

The dynamical interactions of compact objects in N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian simulations, no \"subgrid physics\" is required to handle collisions and mergers. We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable universe.

Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms.

However, the detailed mechanisms by which flux emergence drives these eruptions remain unclear and require numerical investigation. Using 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the interaction between emerging flux and background magnetic fields and dynamics of the induced eruptions. By systematically varying the strength and angle of the emerging magnetic field relative to the background field, we investigate its impact on the initiation and evolution of solar eruptions. The simulations show that magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and background field drives the formation of current sheets, magnetic islands and multithermal jets. Stronger magnetic fields result in earlier eruptions, more energetic jets, and enhanced heating. The formation and ejection of magnetic islands affect the structure and dynamics of the jet. When the hot and cool components of jets reach the other footpoint of magnetic loops, they will generate spicules near the transition region. Varying the angle between the emerging flux and the background field, we find that larger angles delay filament ascent and eruption timing but facilitate filament formation. Filaments form a hot shell and oscillate with a period of 10 minutes driven by periodic plasma ejections. Repetitive reconnection events inject cold plasma into the self-consistently formed filament channel, introducing a new prominence formation mechanism by flux-emergence-fed injection. Our analysis highlights the dynamic interplay between magnetic reconnection, plasma cooling and heating, and filament dynamics.

Frequency differences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar density, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations -- probe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence Sun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large separations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep regime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.","published":"2025-04-02T15:37:26Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas\/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H\/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and\/or higher H\/C.

We present a photodynamical analysis of 10 years of transit data that confirms the previous mass estimates (30.8 +\/- 1.3 M_E and 11.1 +\/- 0.4 M_E), but reduces the median eccentricities to 0.04 +\/- 0.02 and 0.07 +\/- 0.02 for b and c, respectively. These values are more consistent with standard formation models, but still involve nonzero free eccentricity. The previously reported high eccentricities appear to be due to a single transit for which measurements taken at twilight mimicked ingress. This resulted in a 12-minute error in the midtransit time. The data that covered 1.3 and 5 so-called super and resonant periods were used to match a Fourier analysis of the transit-timing variation signal with simple analytic expressions for the frequencies and amplitudes to obtain planet mass estimates within 2% of the median photodynamical values, regardless of the eccentricities. Theoretical details of the analysis are presented in a companion paper. Additionally, we identified a possible planet candidate situated exterior to the b-c pair. Finally, in contrast to a previous study, our internal structure modeling of K2-19 b yields a metal mass fraction that is consistent with core accretion.","published":"2025-10-02T13:00:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Yet Cassini remote sensing data are coarse, topographic data are largely lacking, and the absence of in situ field measurements means we have little understanding of what the surface is composed of. At present, our knowledge of Titan's hydrology is comparable to that of Mars in the 1970's during the Viking era. Fortunately, the coming decades promise many new and exciting discoveries that can be achieved through Earth-based experiments, numerical modeling, and a continued commitment to the exploration of Titan by future missions, including both Dragonfly and orbiting assets. We therefore close the chapter with a discussion about what can be done with the current Cassini data and how new data, from both Dragonfly and a potential future orbiter, would allow us to leverage Titan to help solve some of the largest problems both here on Earth and on hydrologic planets and exoplanets more generally.","published":"2025-02-04T18:30:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Foreground cleaning is performed either in harmonic or pixel space after data cuts have excluded sky areas of strong contamination. We present a nearly full-sky CMB temperature map with only 1% of pixels masked. To derive this map, we make use of six full-sky template maps at foreground-dominated frequencies from different experiments smoothed to $1^\\circ$ and rely on the combination of these weighted maps to trace the morphology of foreground contamination. We do not impose any spectral index constraints, but only fit for template amplitudes at each target frequency. We clean WMAP and Planck maps at a set of target frequencies and conduct quality tests at the level of the maps, pixel histograms and power spectra to select four CMB maps that are cleaned with negligible foreground contamination and only 1% masked pixels and no inpainting.

The model covers atmospheric pressure range from $1.1 \\times 10^{3}$ bar to $7.4 \\times 10^{-11}$ bar and is the first model that incorporates sulfur chemistry when spanning an atmospheric region of this extent. This model incorporates a new version of the STAND reaction network with updated NH4SH chemistry, and updated Antoine equation parameters for NH4SH and H2S. Validation against current models of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that our model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features. Since one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it correctly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1 and 1 bar. It also describes the chemistry of HCN throughout the atmosphere and discovers a region in the stratosphere between $1 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $6.76 \\times 10^{-8}$ bar, where HCN forms through radical chemistry with maximum mixing ratio 33 ppb at $2.94 \\times 10^{-7}$ bar -- a prediction testable by observations. At the same time, our model predicts a quenched N2 mixing ratio 490 ppm up to 10$^{-6}$ bar. The model therefore successfully bridges the gap between existing models of separate regions of Jupiter's atmosphere and makes new testable predictions of several chemical species.","published":"2025-09-04T09:11:28Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Previous observations of the intracluster medium were limited to less than R500. We aim to significantly extend the X-ray coverage. We used data from 5 SRG\/eROSITA all-sky surveys and performed a detailed 1- and 2-dimensional X-ray surface brightness analysis, tracing hot gas emission from kpc to Mpc scales with a single instrument. We compared the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlated the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. In the inner regions within R500, we see previously known features, such as a large-scale spiral-shaped edge; however, we do not find obvious evidence of the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover emission fingers beyond R500 to the west and southeast and excesses that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers - galaxies and globular clusters - to be correlated with the X-ray-excess regions, favoring the infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent bridge of low-surface-brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with eROSITA. With eROSITA, we witness the growth of a cluster along large-scale filaments.","published":"2025-03-04T18:59:58Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA"]}

We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations.

Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\\bullet, {\\rm lim}} \\simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\\bullet, {\\rm lim}} \\simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.","published":"2025-01-10T10:36:23Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"]}

We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter.

Here, we present a set of 4 JWST\/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to late 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar contamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength range, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even at relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar modeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in our spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead using Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet atmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are able to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\\gtrsim$ 80$\\%$ by volume) atmospheres at better than a 3$\\sigma$ level.

Methods have been developed to measure upper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere, but due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is more complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the component of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of refraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of light that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's detector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a strobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations transverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror' seeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between pairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence within the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed with different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at different separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path turbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal and airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was installed in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path turbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds.

Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.","published":"2025-06-03T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO"]}
{"id":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2505.03930v1","title":"Coronal rain formation in a two-fluid approximation","abstract":"Coronal rain, observed in 3D spine-fan magnetic configurations, results from thermal instability in the solar corona, where runaway in-situ cooling causes plasma to condense and drain along the magnetic lines. The reconnection of the magnetic field lines around the null point creates jets, seen as denser structures traveling along the field lines. As these dense regions evolve, thermal instability can set in and ultimately form coronal rain. In this paper we study the importance of partial ionization effects in the formation of coronal rain in the late evolution of 3D spine-fan magnetic reconnection in the solar corona. We use a two-fluid model consisting of neutral and charged particles coupled by collisions, where ionization recombination processes are taken into account. To trigger the thermal instability, we here investigate how magnetic reconnection generates flows that lead to the accumulation of higher-density structures along magnetic field lines. The dynamics associated with the spine-fan magnetic reconnection produces current sheets around the null point and flows along the field lines. Blobs similar to coronal rain start to appear after 400 seconds in the simulation domain which follow the field lines from the direction of the perturbed null point.   The temperature drop is accompanied by recombination of charged particles. Recombination effects become important in coronal rain evolution when the temperature drops considerably in the condensed structures. The neutrals are slowed down by recombination, producing decoupling in velocity at the size of the blob, but inside the condensing structure, the neutrals can move faster across the field lines, creating small scale structures. This study presents a novel two-fluid approach to coronal rain, showing that incorporating two-fluid effects is essential for accurately capturing its dynamics.","published":"2025-05-06T19:09:45Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

These events are often linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their shocks, but the mechanisms governing their global particle distribution remain debated. The 13 March 2023 event is particularly notable as a widespread SEP event associated with an exceptionally fast interplanetary shock. With speeds of up to 3000 km\/s, it is one of the most extreme shocks observed in recent years.   We aim to investigate whether the flanks of a wide CME-driven shock can decouple from the CME and continue propagating as freely propagating shock waves. If shocks are the primary SEP source, such a mechanism could help explain some of the widest SEP events.   Using EUHFORIA, a 3D magnetohydrodynamic heliospheric model, we simulated the evolution of wide CME-driven shocks. We modified the model to allow direct shock injection at the inner boundary, upstream of the CME ejecta. Applying this to the 13 March 2023 event, we modelled two simultaneous CMEs whose shocks form a single, wide shock envelope that spans 280{\\deg} in longitude. We then compared our results to in situ observations.   Our simulations show that the flanks of wide CME shocks can persist as freely propagating waves beyond 2 au. For the 13 March 2023 event, the modelled shock arrival times and amplitudes of associated plasma parameters (e.g. speed and density) show good agreement with observations from various spacecraft distributed across different radial distances and longitudes. Furthermore, the combined shock structure expands into a quasi-circumsolar wave as it propagates outwards.   These findings indicate that the shock flanks of fast CMEs can persist for a long time, supporting the idea that such freely propagating shock flanks play a key role in the global distribution of SEPs in widespread events.","published":"2025-05-05T17:08:22Z","categories":["physics.space-ph","astro-ph.SR"]}

It quantifies the approximation of smoothing the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. In the case of Yukawa theories, which enjoy a linear Klein--Gordon equation, the averaging commutes with the field equation as one might expect. While all small-scale distributions of matter lead to field distributions with the same mean, the latter can have different energy densities and pressures when the Compton wavelength of the field is smaller than the smoothing scale. In the non-linear case, such as chameleon theories, this study quantifies the error made by averaging the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. While field fluctuations can become arbitrarily large when the matter source is screened, the commutativity property of linear theories is recovered in the unscreened regime. Implications for cosmology -- and in particular the equation of state in extended quintessence models -- and for laboratory experiments in low density medium are discussed. This analysis, although based on a simplifying description, sheds light on the effects of the small-scale distribution of matter as well as on the care required to define their equation of state and their cosmological signature.","published":"2025-05-06T18:30:14Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.CO"]}

They arise from the interaction of strongly coupled hydrodynamic, magnetic, and radiative properties of the plasma. In particular, modulations in the photospheric magnetic field strength cause variations in density and opacity along the line of sight, leading to their formation. Therefore, the striation patterns can be used as valuable diagnostics for studying the finest-scale structure of the photospheric magnetic field. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope allows observations of the solar atmosphere with a spatial resolution of better than 0.\"03 with its current instrumentation. We analyze images acquired with the Visible Broadband Imager using the G-band channel to investigate the characteristics of fine-scale striations in the photosphere and compare them with state-of-the-art radiation-MHD simulations at similar spatial resolution. Both observed and synthetic images reveal photospheric striae with widths of approximately 20$-$50 km, suggesting that at least 4-meter class solar telescopes are necessary to resolve this ultrafine structure. Analysis of the numerical simulations confirms that the striation observed in the filtergrams is associated with spatial variations in photospheric magnetic flux concentrations, which cause shifts in the geometrical height where the emergent intensity forms. Some fine-scale striation in the synthetic images originate from magnetic field variations of approximately a hundred Gauss, resulting in a Wilson depressions as narrow as 10 km. This suggests that DKIST G-band images can trace footprints of magnetic field variations and Wilson depressions at a similar scale.","published":"2025-05-06T20:26:12Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

As an alternative, we consider a number of approaches based on artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that a signal recorded by a fluorescence telescope within one time frame might be enough to reconstruct the energy of a primary particle with reasonable accuracy using an ensemble of simple convolutional neural networks. Contrary to the conventional approach, reconstruction of the shower geometry is not needed for this. More than this, preliminary estimates can be obtained even without recognizing the shower track. However, there remain some problems that do not allow us to claim that the suggested method is universal and always works. We discuss difficulties that we faced and possible ways of improving the method.","published":"2025-10-12T19:57:48Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM"]}

The broad He ii${\\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\\approx}$ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne\/O, N\/O, and Ar\/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe\/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km\/s) H${\\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor ${\\eta \\sim 0.2}$.

Estimates of its age and mass vary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K, log(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and heterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using mid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR measurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in age and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST\/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C, F1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar model. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species (CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to isochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy distribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to constrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere models fit best, consistent with the L0\/L2 spectral type and position near silicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7 Myr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling yielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by 30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous best value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the deuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the Columba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring spectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and temperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving the overall characterization of kAndb.","published":"2025-09-03T18:22:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Moreover, the statistics of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{lens}}^2$, in stationary Gaussian noise, are fully understood, in contrast to machine learning methods. $\\chi_{\\mathrm{lens}}^2$ can, therefore, be used to rapidly and accurately weed out the vast majority of unlensed candidate pairs and identify lensed pairs.","published":"2025-02-02T16:32:58Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.IM"]}

While this quadratic combination of cross-correlated data maximizes the {\\em deflection} (signal-to-noise ratio), it does not maximize the detection probability at fixed false-alarm probability (FAP), and therefore is not Neyman-Pearson (NP) optimal for the assumed noise and signal models.

As a result, it is no longer a valid assumption to ignore cosmological evolution along the line of sight from one end of the survey to the other. When extracting cosmological information, the power spectrum becomes suboptimal because it relies on the assumption of translational invariance of the observed field. For example, during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the 21cm brightness temperature field on the nearby (low-redshift) end of a large survey volume exhibits statistical properties that differ significantly from those at far (high-redshift) end. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a eigen decomposition-inspired non-Fourier basis that captures evolution effects. Our work demonstrates that using this new basis integrated in a new summary statistic yields tighter constraints on astrophysical parameters compared to the traditional power spectrum. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example and a practical guide for applying this basis in the context of a realistic forecast for interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).","published":"2025-05-14T18:00:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Measurements of the total [D\/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D\/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D\/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D\/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D\/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D\/H].

Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1\/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1\/r^3$ falloff.

This prompts investigations into how fast such variability can be. Conventionally, the data are often binned to examine the time variability such that the measurement in each bin is above the minimum detectable polarization (MDP). Here we demonstrate that this is unnecessary, and even below the MDP, one can infer the posterior distribution of PA reliably using the Bayesian approach and still be able to place useful constraints on the physics in many cases, due to small relative uncertainties on PA (e.g., $\\Delta$PA $\\approx$ 10--30$^\\circ$ compared with a dynamical range of 180$^\\circ$).

Instead, the PA swings between two discrete angles, suggesting that there are two emitting components, e.g., the boundary layer and the spreading layer, competing with each other. In XTE J1701-462, we confirmed previous results for a variable PA in the normal branch, and furthermore, revealed that the variation timescale could be as short as 1.5 hours.

We also explore the impact of adopting two different geometries for the host, a spheroidal geometry, more appropriate for late-stage mergers, and a disc geometry, more appropriate for galaxies forming stars with secular processes. We use optical to submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) and utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo SED-fitting code. We use exclusively radiative transfer models for the AGN torus as well as for the starburst and host galaxy. We concentrate on a sample of 200 galaxies at z~2, selected in the ELAIS-N1 field. All galaxies have a detection at 250um which ensures the presence of a starburst. We find that the stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies can be robustly estimated by the SED fitting but the AGN fraction depends very much on the adopted torus model.

The peak frequencies span three orders of magnitude from 100 MHz to 170 GHz, corresponding to linear sizes ranging from sub-pc to $>$ 10 kpc. In the future, when combined with high-resolution radio imaging, these results will offer valuable constraints on the molecular gas content of the CGM, as well as the ages and duty cycles of AGN jets. The ever-growing ALMACAL data set will remain an indispensable resource for studying the various aspects of galaxy formation and evolution.","published":"2025-04-11T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

A promising explanation of QPEs is an emission produced when a stellar-mass object orbiting a central supermassive black hole crosses an accretion disk. If the companion is a compact object, such systems would be a prospective multi-messenger target for the space-based observatory LISA and its successors. Here we quantify the prospects for joint X-ray and GW detection of QPEs with orbital frequency in the mHz band using a minimal flare-emission model. Our analysis shows that X-ray observations are most effective at orbital frequencies up to roughly 1 mHz, whereas LISA is sensitive chiefly above about 1 mHz. Because the optimal sensitivity windows overlap only marginally, we predict at most one joint detection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime. Extending GW sensitivity into the sub-millihertz regime (< 0.1 mHz) would raise the possibility of the joint detection by an order of magnitude, enabling QPEs as an interesting multi-messenger target.","published":"2025-05-15T16:43:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"]}

Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models.

The full catalog contains over 400k detected clusters with richnesses, Ngals, above 5 and that reach redshifts up to 1.3. We also provide a version of the catalog where the observation depth and richness computation are homogenized to be used for cosmology, containing 33k rich (Ngals >25) clusters. We compare our results with the previous WaZP catalog obtained from the DES first-year data release (DES-Y1). We find that essentially all clusters within the common footprint and depth limit are recovered. The deeper observations on DES-Y6 and the more complete available spectroscopic redshift sample lead to improvements in the redshifts of the clusters, resulting in an average scatter of 1.4% and offset of 0.2%. The optical clusters are also cross-matched with Sunyaev Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) cluster samples detected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We find that essentially all SZE clusters with reasonable overlapping footprint have a corresponding WaZP cluster. Conversely, 90% of the optical detections with richness greater than 150 have a counterpart in the deeper regions of the SZE surveys. Based on cross-match with the SZE catalogs, we also find that 15-20% of the SZE matched systems have more than one possible WaZP counterpart at the same redshift and within the SZE R500c, indicating possible interacting or unrelaxed systems. Finally, given the optical and SZE beams, WaZP and SZE centerings are found to be consistent. A more detailed study of the SZE-WaZP mass-richness relation will be presented in a separate paper.","published":"2025-07-07T18:00:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Although there is no direct observational evidence to definitively determine the formation pathways of SNe Ia, studying the physical properties of DWDs provides valuable insights into their evolutionary processes, interaction modes, and merger mechanisms, which are essential for understanding the explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia. This study aims to identify DWD candidates through spectroscopic radial velocity measurements and analyze their physical properties based on DESI EDR. We crossmatched DESI EDR with the Gaia EDR3 to select DA. We measured the spectroscopic RV using the cross-correlation function and assessed the significance of RV variability using a chi-squared-based variability method. Spectroscopic Teff and log g were derived by fitting the hydrogen Balmer lines, with 3D convection corrections applied. Orbital periods and semi-amplitudes were obtained through a Lomb-Scargle analysis of the RV time series. We interpolated WD cooling models and applied Monte Carlo simulations to calculate masses, cooling ages, radii, and their associated uncertainties. We also analyzed their photometric and spectral energy distribution properties to derive photometric temperatures and radii, which were then compared with the corresponding spectroscopic parameters. We identified 33 DA DWD candidates with significant RV variability, including 28 new discoveries. Among them, we found an extremely low-mass DWD candidate and a potential triple system. For these candidates, we measured key physical parameters including Teff, log g, mass, and radius, and estimated the orbital periods based on the available data. Of these, 17 candidates exhibit relatively clear periodic RV variability in the current data, and we report their best-fitting periods and RV semi-amplitudes.","published":"2025-09-02T04:04:55Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

We use the HELIOS code (LTE) in the lower and the Cloudy code (LTE or NLTE) in the middle and upper atmosphere to compute the temperature-pressure (TP) and abundance profiles. We further use Cloudy to compute the theoretical planetary transmission spectrum both in LTE and NLTE for comparison with observations. We find an isothermal TP profile at pressures higher than 10 mbar and lower than 10$^{-8}$ bar, with an almost linear increase from about 2200 K to about 8100 K in between. The temperature structure is driven by NLTE effects, particularly in the form of increased heating resulting from the overpopulation of long-lived FeII levels with strong transitions in the NUV band, where the stellar emission is strong, and of decreased cooling due to the underpopulation of MgI and MgII levels that dominate the cooling. The planetary atmosphere is hydrostatic up to pressures of about 1 nbar, and thus accurately modelling spectral lines forming at pressures lower than about 1 nbar requires accounting for both hydrodynamics and NLTE effects. The NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum overestimates the observed H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ absorption, while the LTE model is in good agreement, which is surprising as the opposite has been found for the other UHJs for which NLTE modelling has been performed. Instead, in the NUV we find an excellent match between the NLTE transmission spectrum and the HST\/UVIS data, contrary to the LTE model. This contrasts previous LTE results requiring SiO absorption to fit the observations. The accurate characterisation of the atmosphere of UHJs is possible only accounting for NLTE effects, and particularly for the level population of Fe and Mg, which dominate heating and cooling, respectively.","published":"2025-06-01T19:32:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Because this region is so close to the host star, it is often assumed that the released gaseous material is rapidly accreted and plays little role in the evolution of the disc composition. However, laboratory experiments show that the thermal decomposition process is irreversible, breaking macromolecular refractory organics into simpler, volatile carbon-bearing compounds. As a result, unlike the iceline of other volatiles, which traps vapor inwards due to recondensation, the organics line remains permeable, allowing gaseous carbon to diffuse outward without returning to the solid phase. In this paper, we investigate how this process affects the disc composition, particularly the gas-phase C\/H and C\/O ratios, by incorporating it into a 1D evolution model for gas and solids, and assuming refractory organics dominantly decompose into C$_2$H$_2$. Our results show that this process allows this carbon-rich gas to survive well beyond the organics line (out to $7 \\mathrm{~au}$ around a solar-mass star) and for much longer timescales, such that its abundance is increased by an order of magnitude. This has several implications in planet formation, notably by altering how the composition of solids and gas relate, and the fraction of heavy elements available to giant planets. In the framework of our model, refractory organics significantly influence the evolution of the gas-phase C\/O ratio, which may help interpreting measurements made with Spitzer and JWST.","published":"2025-05-26T18:24:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.","published":"2025-01-15T11:03:34Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.EP","physics.flu-dyn"]}

We also find that the collision rates are appreciably high regardless of the low collision velocities. Corresponding timescales are on the order of ten Keplerian periods or shorter, suggesting that dust grains can overcome the drift barrier as well.

The Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs are filled with striking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful targets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived, episodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies' evolution. In this paper, we greatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies drawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images and point-source photometry for 216 systems, whose sizes are well-matched to the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of the sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images display rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions, stellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional chance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting highly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond this atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more detailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and spectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of obvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and interacting galaxies, resolved stellar populations at the extremes of stellar density, the properties of young massive stars and stellar clusters, the physics of the cold ISM and dust, and stellar and gas dynamics.","published":"2025-09-10T21:13:42Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from \"cosmological collider physics\" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \\leq 0.071$, M$_\\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $< 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.","published":"2025-03-03T19:00:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

In this work, we perform binary population synthesis with an updated binary mass transfer stability criterion and try to understand the details of mass transfer processes by constructing a series of Be star + He star (BeHe) binary populations. We found that the simulations and the observations can be divided into two groups according to the masses of components, corresponding to the two distinct evolutionary processes during the mass transfer. In particular, we found that the mass ratios of BeHe binaries may be taken as a probe of the initial mass ratios of the primordial binaries. Moreover, the results suggest that a higher mass transfer efficiency ($\\gtrsim 0.5$) supports the observations better. The simulations predicted too many Be star binaries experiencing Case B mass transfer, which conflicts with the observations. The reason is due to either observational selection effects or unclear physical factors.","published":"2025-06-03T09:13:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

A possible termination of the $rp$-process at around ${}^{84}$Mo was previously suggested by the formation of a ZrNb cycle. We report here precision mass measurements at around ${}^{84}$Mo, which have concluded the possibility of the cycle. The experiment was conducted using the multi-reflection time-of-flight spectrograph at RIKEN RI Beam Factory, and the masses of ${}^{79}$Y, ${}^{83}$Nb, ${}^{84}$Mo, ${}^{88}$Ru, and an isomer in ${}^{78}$Y were measured. For ${}^{84}$Mo, and ${}^{88}$Ru, and the isomeric state of ${}^{78}$Y, their masses are experimentally determined for the first time with uncertainties of $\\delta m \\approx 20~{\\rm keV\/c^2}$. The mass precision of ${}^{79}$Y and ${}^{83}$Nb is improved to $13~{\\rm keV\/c^2}$ and $9.6~{\\rm keV\/c^2}$, respectively. The new $\\alpha$-separation energy of ${}^{84}$Mo, 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The X-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the $A=80-90$ mass region.

Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition\/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (github.com\/predsci\/hipft). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis\/post-processing options, and example use cases.","published":"2025-01-10T22:55:45Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.comp-ph"]}

These techniques are sensitive to planets in close orbits, not being able to probe large star--planet separations. $\\mu$-lensing is the indirect method that allows us to probe the planetary systems at the snow-line and beyond, but it is not a repeatable observation. On the contrary, direct imaging (DI) allows for the detection and characterization of low mass companions at wide separation (\\mbox{$\\leq$ 5--6 au}). The main challenge of DI is that a typical planet--star contrast ranges from $10^{-6}$, for a young Jupiter in emitted light, to $10^{-9}$ for Earth in reflected light. In the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to combining large (D $\\geq$ 5 m) telescopes (to reduce the impact of diffraction) with coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics (to correct phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence), with sophisticated image post-processing, to reach such a contrast between the star and the planet in order to detect and characterize cooler and closer companions to nearby stars. Building on the first pioneering instrumentation, the second generation of high-contrast imagers, SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO, allowed us to probe hundreds of stars (e.g., 500--600 stars using SHINE and GPIES), contributing to a better understanding of the demography and the occurrence of planetary systems. The DI offers a possible clear vision for studying the formation and physical properties of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs, and the future DI (space and ground-based) instruments with deeper detection limits will enhance this vision. In this paper, we briefly review the methods, the instruments, the main sample of targeted stars, the remarkable results, and the perspective of this rising technique.","published":"2025-01-14T09:50:25Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM","astro-ph.EP"]}

However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\\gtrapprox 0.25^\\circ$, equivalent to $\\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\\gtrapprox$ 100,000).

With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.","published":"2025-05-19T14:11:53Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in the realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas reservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of interest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance of around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the interaction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a resembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of G2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar) source still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report the orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital trace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very small, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we show that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of the massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that the small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the orbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent with the orbital motion of IRS 16SW.","published":"2025-10-01T13:40:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

This requires them to be in an equilibrium involving magnetic fields and hydrodynamic forces. Unfortunately, theoretical models of sunspot equilibrium are very simplified as they assume that spots are static and possess a self-similar and axially symmetric magnetic field. These assumptions neglect the role of small scale variations of the magnetic field along the azimuthal direction produced by umbral dots, light bridges, penumbral filaments, and so forth. We aim at studying whether sunspot equilibrium is maintained once azimuthal fluctuations in the magnetic field, produced by the sunspot fine structure, are taken into account. To this end we apply the FIRTEZ Stokes inversion code to spectropolarimetric observations to infer the magnetic and thermodynamic parameters in two sunspots located at disk center and observed with two different instruments: one observed from the ground with the 1.5-meter German GREGOR Telescope and another with the Japanese spacecraft Hinode. We compare our results with three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a sunspot carried out with the MuRAM code. We infer clear variations in the gas pressure and density of the plasma directly related to fluctuations in the Lorentz force and associated with the filamentary structure in the penumbra. Similar results are obtained in the umbra despite its lack of observed filamentary structure. Results from the two observed sunspots are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the magnetic topology of sunspots along the azimuthal direction is very close to magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, thereby helping to explain why sunspots are such long-lived structures capable of surviving on the solar surface for days or even full solar rotations.","published":"2025-05-29T20:28:23Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\\chi \\lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\\chi \\lesssim 0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog.

Neither do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as expected for tidal spin-up scenarios.

Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\\log(1+\\delta^{\\prime}_{3})$ from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B\/T$), which spans 0.25-1. In the {\\sc IllustrisTNG} simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\\ast,\\mathrm{ex\\text{-}situ}}$) -- a proxy for mergers -- is instead the dominant predictor of $B\/T$. Galaxies with high $B\/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\\sim$20-30%). In contrast, some high-$B\/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes -- such as violent disk instabilities -- also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.","published":"2025-05-06T00:52:46Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

It is often measured via cross-correlations of CMB data with large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to constrain gas physics and improve cosmological constraints. The largest source of bias to these measurements is the leakage of poorly understood thermal dust emission from star-forming galaxies -- the cosmic infrared background (CIB) -- into the tSZ maps. This CIB contamination is difficult to clean via multifrequency component separation methods, such as internal linear combination (ILC), due to uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution (SED), which exhibits spatial and line-of-sight variation and decorrelation. Thus, improved ILC-based techniques have been developed to null (\"deproject\") both the CIB and its first moment with respect to the emissivity index $\\beta$ in order to robustly remove the CIB despite the lack of first-principles knowledge of its SED. While decreasing the bias, such procedures can significantly increase the noise in the resulting ILC maps. In this paper, we develop a data-driven algorithm for determining the optimal CIB SED to deproject when measuring a tSZ-LSS cross-correlation, obviating the need to deproject the first moment in the ILC map used for such a measurement. Our method gives an unbiased cross-correlation with increased signal-to-noise. We demonstrate its efficacy on simulations, finding a 60% improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio for an example tSZ cross-correlation with a halo sample at redshifts $0.8 < z < 1.8$, as compared to moment deprojection approaches. Though used here for CIB removal in tSZ cross-correlations, our method is broadly applicable to minimizing contaminant leakage in ILC maps. Our code is available in CIB-deproj.","published":"2025-05-20T17:31:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Our model is based on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the \\textsc{Abacus}\\textsc{Summit} simulations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which include the redshift-space distortions and Alcock-Paczynski distortions, incorporate survey realism, including survey geometry and veto masks, and account for angular plus radial selection effects. The cosmological and HOD parameter dependence of the MFs is captured with a neural network emulator trained from the galaxy mocks with various cosmological and HOD parameters. To benchmark the constraining power of the MFs, we also train an emulator for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) using the same pipeline. Having validated our approach through successful parameter recovery tests on both internal and external mocks, including non-HOD forward models of the halo-galaxy connection, we apply our forward model to analyze the CMASS data in the redshift range $0.45<z<0.58$.

This yields a closed expression for an emergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological constant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum corrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of the phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the usual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave background observables and derivatives of the phase.

Here we present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible ways forward for future models.","published":"2025-10-12T23:19:22Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved in star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their associated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law component in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus star-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a wide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular clouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar objects (YSOs) and mid-\/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation rates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation between the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a universally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas phase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities ($N_{{\\mbox {threshold}}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely distributed over the range of $\\sim$1--17$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on N-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency with the traditional approach using $A_{\\rm V}$ $\\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in high turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical approach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the same correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our findings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law component of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.","published":"2025-05-12T17:10:22Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\\sim 0.01~{\\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.","published":"2025-05-11T12:37:09Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the \"damped random walk\" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.","published":"2025-05-14T22:23:08Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.IM"]}

Their rotational angular momenta are essentially the same as those at the zero-age main sequence. The angular momentum dissipation experienced by these stars during their pre-main sequence phase is also relatively weak, so their rotational angular momentum can reflect the parameters of their parental molecular clouds. The reliability of angular momentum measurements was evaluated based on the phenomenon of angular momentum conservation observed in stars before and after the turn-off point in observational data. We find that stars with masses between 1.4$M_\\odot$ and 1.8$M_\\odot$ show an inverse proportionality between angular momentum and isochrone age. We propose that the angular momentum-age correlation reflects changes in the star-forming environment in the Milky Way's history. Besides, the observed inverse proportionality implies that, as the Milky Way has evolved, the stars formed within it tend to possess greater rotational angular momenta. This trend would promote the fragmentation of stars during the pre-main sequence phase and inhibit the formation of massive stars, providing a useful perspective for explaining variations in the initial mass function.","published":"2025-01-02T03:30:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"]}

Modelling this rich data set with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations is required to further our understanding of the shortcomings in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution models. We develop forward models for the stacked X-ray radial surface brightness profile measured by eROSITA around MW-mass galaxies. Our model contains two emitting components: hot gas (around central galaxies and satellite galaxies hosted by more massive halos) and X-ray point sources (X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei). We model the hot gas profile using the TNG300-based products. We generate mock observations with our TNG300-based model (matching stellar mass and redshift with observations) with different underlying halo mass distributions. We show that for the same mean stellar mass, a factor 2x increase in the mean value of the underlying halo mass distribution results in a ~4x increase in the stacked X-ray luminosity from the hot CGM. The point sources are described by a simple point-spread-function (PSF) of eROSITA, and we fit their normalization in this work. Using empirical models to derive a permissible range of AGN and XRB luminosities in the MW-mass X-ray galaxy stack, we choose our forward model best describing the hot CGM for the eROSITA observations. We find that at < 40 kpc from the galaxy centre, the hot CGM from central galaxies and the X-ray point sources emission each account for 40-50% of the total X-ray emission budget.

Systematic appearance of type-A QPOs preceding radio flares in several sources suggests that type-A QPOs indicate telltale signs of jet ejection, while type-B QPOs are closely linked with radio flares (i.e., transient jets). Present findings suggest the corona evolves from a radially extended to a vertically elongated structure during the type-C to type-B transition via type-A QPOs, with type-B QPOs linked to radially compact or vertically extended coronal geometries, resembling jet ejection.

Since these peculiarities are not limited to the merger product's surface, we use asteroseismology to predict how the differences in the internal structure of a merger product and a genuine single star manifest via properties of non-radial stellar pulsations. We mapped the result of a 3D MHD stellar merger simulation between a 9 and an 8 solar-mass MS star to 1D and evolved it through the MS. We compare the predicted pressure (p) and gravity (g) modes for the merger product model with those predicted for a corresponding genuine single-star model. The p-mode frequencies are consistently lower for the merger product than for the genuine single star, and the differences between them are more than a thousand times larger than the current best observational uncertainties for measured mode frequencies of this kind. Even though g-mode period spacing differences vary in value and sign throughout the MS, they, too, are larger than the current best observational uncertainties for such long-period modes. This, combined with additional variability in the merger product's period spacing patterns, shows the potential of identifying merger products in future-forward modelling. We also attempt to replicate the merger product's structure using three widely applied 1D merger prescriptions and repeat the asteroseismic analysis. Although none of the 1D prescriptions reproduces the entire merger product's structure, we conclude that the prescription with shock heating shows the highest potential, provided that it can be calibrated on binary-evolution-driven 3D merger simulations. Our work should be expanded to encompass the various possible merger product structures predicted to exist in the Universe.

We perform the first steps towards a measurement of such effect using the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest in the spectra of bright quasars as a tracer of cosmological expansion. Our goal is to determine to which precision a velocity shift measurement can be carried out with the signal-to-noise (S\/N) level currently available and whether this precision aligns with previous theoretical expectations. A precise assessment of the achievable measurement precision is fundamental for estimating the time required to carry out the whole project. We acquire 12 hours of ESPRESSO observations distributed over 0.875 years of the brightest quasar known, J052915.80-435152.0 (z=3.962), to obtain high-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, with median S\/N of ~86 per 1 km\/s pixel at the continuum. We divide the observations into two epochs and analyse them using both a pixel-by-pixel method and a model-based approach. This comparison allows us to estimate the velocity shift between the epochs, as well as the velocity precision that can be achieved at this S\/N. The model-based method is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of the intergalactic medium, and it provides greater accuracy compared to the pixel-by-pixel approach. We measure a velocity drift of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest consistent with zero: $\\Delta v = -1.25\\pm 4.45 {\\rm ms^{-1}}$, equivalent to a cosmological drift of $\\dot{v}=-1.43\\pm 5.09 {\\rm ms^{-1}yr^{-1}}$ or $\\dot{z}= (-2.19\\pm7.77) \\times 10^{-8}{\\rm yr^{-1}}$.

While structure formation models are well-understood, the development of an effective field-level bias model remains imprecise, particularly in the context of tracer perturbation theory within Bayesian reconstruction methods, which we address in this work. To bridge this gap, we have developed a differentiable model that integrates augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory, nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic biasing. At the core of our approach is the Hierarchical Cosmic-Web Biasing Nonlocal (HICOBIAN) model, which provides a positive definite description of tracer bias while incorporating a long- and short-range nonlocal framework via cosmic-web regions and deviations from Poissonity in the likelihood. A key insight of our model is that transitions between cosmic-web regions are inherently smooth, which we implement using sigmoid-based gradient operations. This enables a fuzzy, and, hence, differentiable hierarchical cosmic-web description, making the model well-suited for machine learning frameworks. Our approach accurately reproduces the primordial density field within associated error bars, as validated by two- and three-point statistics in Fourier space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology approaches the maximum encoded information consistent with Poisson noise. We introduce a Bayesian field-level inference algorithm that leverages the same forward modelling framework used in galaxy, quasar, and Lyman alpha forest mock catalog generation -- including nonlinear, nonlocal and stochastic bias with redshift space distortions -- providing a unified and consistent approach to the analysis of large-scale cosmic structure.","published":"2025-06-04T14:01:32Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \\lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\\sigma$ detection in $<50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $<75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.","published":"2025-10-01T12:19:36Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

These catalogues are much easier to produce than it is to develop and validate a likelihood.

The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.","published":"2025-04-04T15:17:26Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO"]}

The movement of F1 from the southeast toward the northwest, driven by the motion of the positive magnetic polarity (P1), leads to a collision and reconnection with F2. This reconnection exchanges their footpoints, resulting in the formation of two new filaments (F3 and F4) consistent with \"slingshot\" type filament interaction. During the interaction, the current sheet moving due to the motion of F1 and the reconnection outflows moving along F3 and F4 were both observed. The current sheet is rarely observed in the slingshot type filament interaction, measuring approximately 2.17 Mm in length and 0.84 Mm in width. After the interaction, the F1 disappears whereas a portion of F2 remains, indicating that the interaction involves partial slingshot reconnection, due to the unequal magnetic flux between the filaments. The residual part of F2 will undergo another magnetic reconnection in the same interaction region with the magnetic loops connecting polarities N1 and P1. The material generated by the reconnection is continuously injected into F4, leading to its final morphology. The findings enhance our understanding of slingshot-type filament interactions, indicating that partial slingshot reconnections between filaments may be more common than full slingshot events.","published":"2025-06-06T01:18:41Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

We employ density functional theory, coupled cluster and multiconfigurational methods to obtain activation and reaction energies for the hydrogenation network of HC_{3}N. This work explores the reaction network of the isolated molecule and constitutes a preview on the reactions occurring on the ice grain surface. We find that the reactions where the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon chain at carbon atom opposite of the cyano-group give the lowest and most narrow barriers. Subsequent hydrogenation leads to the astrochemically relevant vinyl cyanide and ethyl cyanide. Alternatively, the cyano-group can hydrogenate via radical-radical reactions, leading to the fully saturated propylamine.

However, the number of unrelated EM transients that might contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of LISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated EM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of MBH mergers, as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that the number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to unity for mergers at $z \\lesssim 0.8$ and at 1 hour before coalescence. After coalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential contaminant expands to $z \\lesssim 1.5$. In contrast, if the redshifts for all transients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the number of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of $\\sim100$, and never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of contaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be non-negligible, especially without redshift information for the detected transients.

However, the existence of ozone in Venus's observable atmosphere, a planet with no known life, raises the possibility of ozone biosignature false-positives on Venus-like exoplanets. We use a photochemical model of Venus's atmosphere to investigate the origin of its mesospheric ozone layer, and to predict how similar ozone layers would manifest for Venus-like exoplanets. For Venus, our model shows that the previously proposed fluxes of O atoms produced on the dayside and transported to the nightside cannot generate enough ozone to match the observed nightside ozone concentrations without also producing O$_2$ in excess of the observed upper limit. Nor can sufficient ozone be produced by varying the lower-atmosphere chemistry, atmospheric thermal structure, or received stellar flux in our model of Venus's atmosphere. These results imply that a presently unknown chemical pathway is responsible for the ozone production in Venus's nightside mesosphere. Ozone production rates from this pathway of 10$^5$--10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$s$^{-1}$ above the cloud layer on the nightside can re-produce the observed O$_3$ concentrations. Generalised to Venus-like exoplanets, known chemistry similarly fails to produce ozone in the abundance seen in the Venusian mesosphere. However, until the origin of Venus's ozone is understood, we cannot rule out that ozone production at concentrations observable with JWST will be common on abiotic Venus-like worlds, a possibility that limits the usefulness of ozone as a habsignature and as a biosignature.","published":"2025-05-22T11:35:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.","published":"2025-10-08T21:35:33Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.HE"]}

Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region.

This study presents a Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual inclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a known probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmquist bias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in the dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the observational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the statistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian scatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two methods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the dependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model that accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the likelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using simulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases in a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical for improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.","published":"2025-04-14T18:00:05Z","categories":["stat.ME","astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.IM"]}

Therefore, we investigate possible effects before, during, and after the merger for a total of three different systems with varying initial eccentricity.   We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close encounters and find good agreement with predicted f-mode frequency estimates. However, our simulations reveal no significant differences compared to results neglecting the magnetic field. Although we observe a rearrangement of the poloidal structure of the magnetic field inside the stars, there is no relevant increase in the magnetic energy during the encounters. Also, during the merger, the amplification of the magnetic field seems to be largely independent of the eccentricity in our systems. Consistent with studies of merging non-magnetized binary neutron stars, we find a correlation between eccentricity and mass ejection, with a higher impact parameter leading to a larger amount of unbound material.","published":"2025-04-14T13:48:10Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.HE"]}

Unstratified simulations are commonly used to study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near the disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these unstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified disks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified simulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations across various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a dimensionless dust stopping time ($\\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during dust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified simulations. Vertical gravity acts to redistribute momentum vertically in response to momentum flux, resulting in midplane velocities in the center-of-mass frame that are consistent with those from unstratified models at any given pressure gradient. Furthermore, the velocity dispersions and density distributions of the gas and dust near the midplane of our stratified simulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further exploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for $\\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas dynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently, our results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in stratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations for the parameter values explored here.","published":"2025-05-29T18:00:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.","published":"2025-01-02T16:20:46Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.HE","hep-ph"]}

Away from the equator, this implies convergence of the Eulerian mean meridional flow in zones (anticyclonic shear) and divergence in belts (cyclonic shear). It indicates lower-tropospheric downwelling in zones and upwelling in belts because the mean meridional circulation almost certainly closes at depth. Yet the observed banded structure of Jupiter's clouds and hazes suggests that there is upwelling in the brighter zones and downwelling in the darker belts. Here, we show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by considering not the Eulerian but the transformed Eulerian mean circulation, which includes a Stokes drift owing to eddies and is a better approximation of the Lagrangian mean transport of tracers such as ammonia. The potential vorticity structure inferred from observations paired with mixing length arguments suggests that there is transformed Eulerian mean upwelling in zones and downwelling in belts.

In this paper, we introduce the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), a groundbreaking survey with three primary objectives: (1) to create a comprehensive Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid of up to one million compact extragalactic sources across the southern ~50 per cent of the sky (20,630 deg$^2$); (2) to map the intrinsic polarisation and RM properties of a wide range of discrete extragalactic and Galactic objects over the same area; and (3) to contribute interferometric data with excellent surface brightness sensitivity, which can be combined with single-dish data to study the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. Observations for the full POSSUM survey commenced in May 2023 and are expected to conclude by mid-2028. POSSUM will achieve an RM grid density of around 30-50 RMs per square degree with a median measurement uncertainty of ~1 rad m$^{-2}$. The survey operates primarily over a frequency range of 800-1088 MHz, with an angular resolution of 20'' and a typical RMS sensitivity in Stokes $Q$ or $U$ of 18 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Additionally, the survey will be supplemented by similar observations covering 1296-1440 MHz over 38 per cent of the sky. POSSUM will enable the discovery and detailed investigation of magnetised phenomena in a wide range of cosmic environments, as well as the interplay between these components. This paper reviews the current science case developed by the POSSUM Collaboration and provides an overview of POSSUM's observations, data processing, outputs, and its complementarity with other radio and multi-wavelength surveys, including future work with the SKA.

Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \\leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \\gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ \/ Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\\sim 10\\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.","published":"2025-03-03T19:00:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA"]}

The reconstruction of the star formation history indicates that the galaxy assembled most of its mass quickly and then rapidly quenched, $\\sim0.4$ Gyr prior to observation. Line diagnostics suggest that the weak emission is probably powered by residual star formation (SFR$\\sim0.2$M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) or a low-luminosity AGN, with no strong evidence for outflows in ionized or neutral gas. We perform a detailed study of the NIR spectral indices by comparing observations with predictions of several state-of-the-art stellar population models. This is unprecedented at such a high redshift. In particular, the analysis of several CO and CN features argues against a heavy contribution of Thermally Pulsating (TP-)AGB stars. Observations align better with models that include a minimal contribution from TP-AGB stars, but they are also consistent with a mild contribution from TP-AGB stars, assuming a younger age (consistent with the fits). The analysis of other NIR spectral indices shows that current models struggle to reproduce observations.

In that respect, numerical simulations have been looking for the \"smoking gun\" signal that could help identify pre-merger systems. Here we study if any of the expected features of circumbinary discs, such as the periodic modulation from the orbiting \"lump\", could be used to identify pre-merger BBHs or if they could be easily confused with other systems. Indeed, while the timing feature associated with the \"lump\" seems to be present for a large part of the parameter space defined by the binary separation and mass ratio in circular binaries, it was recently proposed to form thanks to an instability occurring naturally at the edge of accretion discs around single black holes (SBH). In order to check if features of a circumbinary disc could be reproduced by a SBH system, we search for at least one SBH fit able to replicate the given synthetic observations of a circumbinary disc. We found that many of the features from a circumbinary disc can be reproduced by a SBH system with different masses, distances or inner disc positions. Interestingly, while we can always find a SBH model providing a good enough fit to the data, the presence of two variabilities, associated with the lump and the binary, or binary-lump beat, period, is a necessary condition for a wide range of BBH system parameters and should be used as a test to disqualify some BBH candidates.","published":"2025-03-06T14:09:48Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"]}

In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed gravitational wave transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. We compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, which was previously reported in the literature. This deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of cluster-scale lenses through gravitational wave transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.","published":"2025-01-03T20:46:24Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc"]}

The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation.

Motivated by these findings, we present new observational constraints on DDE based on the cross-correlation between DESI Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) samples and CMB lensing ($\\mathrm{CMB}_{\\kappa} \\times \\mathrm{LRG}$), which effectively probes the impact of cosmological parameters on the growth of structure at the perturbative level. We demonstrate that, when combined with geometric measurements such as BAO and SNIa, this cross-correlation yields compelling statistical evidence for DDE exceeding $4\\sigma$, including within simpler parametrizations such as the $w$CDM model. Remarkably, this evidence is independent of constraints from primary Planck CMB anisotropies data. These results highlight the robustness and potential of Galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlation as a powerful observational probe of the dark sector, particularly when used in conjunction with geometric observables.","published":"2025-05-30T11:09:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Our results indicate that, similar to LGRBs, a strong redshift evolution in either luminosity or density is necessary to accurately account for the observations, regardless of the specific form of the LF assumed. The LF of LGRBs remains a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting it follows a BPL form, while others advocate for a TPL form.

{"id":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2505.07238v1","title":"Tracing the evolution of eccentric precessing binary black holes: a   hybrid approach","abstract":"To describe a general bound binary black hole system, we need to consider orbital eccentricity and the misalignment of black holes' spin vectors with respect to the orbital angular momentum. While binary black holes produced through many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger, they often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation, and dynamical interactions could produce binaries with non-negligible eccentricity in the bands of current and proposed gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Another quantity that carries information about the formation channel is the angle between each black hole's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum (referred to as the spin tilt) at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW astronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector, but these can differ significantly from those at formation. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at formation. For many formation scenarios, the tilts in the formal limit of infinite orbital angular momentum, also known as tilts at infinity, are a good approximation to those at formation. We thus generalize the publicly available \\texttt{tilts\\_at\\_infinity} code to compute the tilts at infinity for eccentric, spin-precessing binaries. This code employs hybrid post-Newtonian evolution, starting with orbit-averaged evolution for higher frequencies and then transitioning to precession-averaged evolution to compute the tilts at infinity. We find that the transition frequency used in the quasicircular case still gives acceptably small errors in the eccentric case, and show that eccentricity and hybrid evolution both have a significant effect on the tilts at infinity for many binaries. Finally, we give examples of cases where the tilts at infinity are and are not a good approximation to the tilts at formation in the eccentric case.","published":"2025-05-12T05:29:27Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"]}
{"id":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2505.13313v2","title":"Early Post Asymptotic Giant Branch Instability: Does it Affect White   Dwarf Hydrogen Envelope Mass?","abstract":"Although most white dwarf stars have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, a significant fraction have atmospheres in which hydrogen is spectroscopically absent, with the fraction of hydrogen-free atmospheres varying with effective temperature. Estimates of the total mass of hydrogen, MH, in the stellar envelope from either asteroseismology or spectral evolution are at odds with predicted values from theoretical stellar evolution modeling. Recent work has found that models in the early post Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase of evolution can exhibit thermally and dynamical unstable behavior. Here we investigate whether this Early Post AGB Instability (EPAGBI) can help resolve the conflict in MH values determined from white dwarf spectral evolution, analysis of DAV pulsations and canonical stellar evolution modeling, by evolving models of mass 1 and 2Msun through the AGB phases and to the white dwarf cooling track. The MH values at the end of the calculations are in the range consistent with asteroseismic determinations. The major impact of EPAGBIs is that they cause loops in the HRD, which are absent when the EPAGBI is suppressed. Such loops might be detectable in a long-term monitoring program, or by their imprint on planetary nebula morphology imparted by the cyclically varying mass loss rate. Since the characteristic timescale of the looping in the HRD depends on the stellar mass, it could provide a way to determine the stellar mass just after AGB departure. Another EPAGBI signature is the production of Li by the Cameron-Fowler process. During the EPAGBI phase the photospheric temperature is always too high for the Li I resonance line to be detected. However, 7Be is convected to the photosphere in significant amounts (up to 400 times the solar photospheric mass fraction) at various times in the EPAGBI phase, which may be detectable by observing the Be II resonance doublet.","published":"2025-05-19T16:28:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a dedicated mission to monitor gamma-ray transients, launched in December, 2020. A real-time on-board trigger and location software, using the traditional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method for blind search, is constrained to relatively bright signals due to the limitations in on-board computing resources and the need for real-time search. In this work, we developed a ground-based pipeline for GECAM to search for various transients, especially for weak bursts missed by on-board software. This pipeline includes both automatic and manual mode, offering options for blind search and targeted search. The targeted search is specifically designed to search for interesting weak bursts, such as gravitational wave-associated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From the ground search of the data in the first year, GECAM has been triggered by 54 GRBs and other transients, including soft gamma-ray repeaters, X-ray binaries, solar flares, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. We report the properties of each type of triggers,such as trigger time and light curves. With this search pipeline and assuming a soft Band spectrum, the GRB detection sensitivity of GECAM is increased to about 1.1E-08 erg cm-2 s-1 (10 keV - 1000 keV, burst duration of 20 s). These results demonstrate that the GECAM ground search system (both blind search and targeted search) is a versatile pipeline to recover true astrophysical signals which were too weak to be found in the on-board search.","published":"2025-03-05T04:06:14Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.IM"]}

Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST\/MIRI revealed 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, detected with an age of at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects.

The disc growth and history of star formation","abstract":"The Milky Way's (MW's) star formation history (SFH) offers insight into the chronology of its assembly and the mechanisms driving its structural development. In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z > 2$ ($\\rm R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and grew to a present-day size of $\\rm R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary peak in SFR $\\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc, which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.","published":"2025-09-02T18:00:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

With the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having steeper spectra.","published":"2025-05-28T09:24:58Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO"]}

We show that Eulerian perturbation theory is adequate for describing this system on large scales, compute the leading $n$-point functions and perform a joint power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum analysis. Beyond the bispectrum which is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between $A$ and the linear bias, we find that addition of the trispectrum reduces the error on $A$ by only $20-30\\%$. Our results for the joint analysis are in good agreement with recent field-level analyses in the same setup. This implies that the field-level inference on large scales does not get significant information from large displacements beyond those in Eulerian kernels or higher-order $n$-point functions beyond the trispectrum. We provide further evidence for this showing that the dependence of the error bars on the maximum wavenumbers used in the analysis is the same in the two approaches. Our results are in disagreement with some of the recent joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using likelihood-free inference based on perturbative forward modeling. We discuss a possible origin of this discrepancy and highlight the importance of resolving it in order to have the optimal results in cosmological analyses based on perturbation theory.","published":"2025-07-07T18:04:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Additionally, 48 ($33\\%$) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 ($10\\%$) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at $z > 7.5$, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at $z>7.5$ have $\\sim 25 \\%$ of their star formation obscured.

With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S\/N $\\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.","published":"2025-05-12T13:45:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.EP"]}

Tidally-heated volcanic satellite simulations sputtering gas into a cloud or toroid orbiting the planet, are able to reproduce the probed line-of-sight column density variations. The estimated SO2 flux is consistent with tidal gravitation predictions, with a Na\/SO2 ratio far smaller than Io's. Although stable satellite orbits at this system are known to be < 15.3 hours, several high-resolution alkali Doppler shift observations are required to constrain a putative orbit.

Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1\/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\\log_{10}(L_{685\\,\\mathrm{MHz}}\/\\mathrm{W\\,Hz}^{-1}) > 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\\log_{10}(L_{685\\,\\mathrm{MHz}}\/\\mathrm{W\\,Hz}^{-1})} <23.5$.

Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at $z\\gtrsim3$. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST\/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only $\\lesssim1\\%$ of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over $3<z<6$ using observed NIRCam colors.

This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as $\\lesssim300$ Myr.

However, it is challenging to disentangle the signal from different LOS portions and separate the contribution from the local ISM. This is particularly relevant since the Sun is located within the Local Bubble (LB), a low-density and hot cavity formed by past SN events, making it essential to investigate how this environment may influence the observed RM values. The present study investigates the imprint of the local environment on the synthetic RM signal, as measured by an observer within a LB-like cavity. The RM derived from diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation produced by CR electrons at decimeter wavelengths is also analyzed. We produce synthetic RM maps for an observer placed inside a LB candidate, selected from a MHD simulation that resembles the properties of the ISM in the Solar vicinity. Using the capabilities of the radiative transfer code POLARIS, we study the imprint of the cavity walls on the RM signal. As the MHD simulation does not account for CR diffusion, we develop a CR toy-model to study the Faraday rotation of the diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation. We find that (i) the imprint of local structures, such as the walls of the LB candidate and the edges of other supernovae blown cavities, is of fundamental importance for interpreting the global Faraday sky; (ii) the LB has a non negligible contribution to the sinusoidal patterns of RM as a function of Galactic longitude seen in observations; and (iii) the RM signal from diffuse synchrotron emission shows a strong correspondence with the RM signal generated by the LB candidate walls.","published":"2025-04-13T19:34:40Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The DESI spectra are used to evaluate the accuracy of the HETDEX object classifications, and tune the methodology to achieve the HETDEX science requirement of $\\lesssim 2\\%$ contamination of the LAE sample by low-redshift emission-line galaxies, while still assigning $96\\%$ of the true Ly$\\alpha$ emission sample with the correct spectroscopic redshift. We compare emission line measurements between the two experiments assuming a simple Gaussian line fitting model. Fitted values for the central wavelength of the emission line, the measured line flux and line widths are consistent between the surveys within uncertainties. Derived spectroscopic redshifts, from the two classification pipelines, when both agree as an LAE classification, are consistent to within $\\langle \\Delta z \/ (1 + z) \\rangle = 6.9\\times 10^{-5}$ with an rms scatter of $3.3\\times 10^{-4}$.","published":"2025-03-04T03:11:58Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma rays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology have opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the upcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We comprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to determine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter regions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the minimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose various constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB, BBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical experiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model and discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We find that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some regions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe constraints from cosmological observations.","published":"2025-04-16T06:48:42Z","categories":["hep-ph","astro-ph.HE"]}

The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be filamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with coherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the magnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of the physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the CNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary FIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are associated with known FIR\/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a coherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is coincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely related to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity limitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with filamentary structures in FIR and\/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for then CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been determined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity deviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to local turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent velocity dispersion of 2.48 < delta_vturb < 3.9 km\/s. The CNM has a mean turbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +\/- 1.6 km\/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all, of the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in filaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.","published":"2025-02-03T10:26:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We numerically investigated dust enrichment and growth during the initial stages of protoplanetary disk formation. A particular objective was to determine the effects of various growth barriers, mimicked by imposing a series of upper permissible limits on maximum dust sizes. Methods. We used the Formation and Evolution of Stars and Disks on nested meshes (ngFEOSAD) code to simulate the three-dimensional dynamics of gas and dust under the polytropic approximation, from the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere to \\approx 12 kyr after the first hydrostatic core and disk formation. Results. We found that dust growth begins in the contracting cloud in the evolution stage that precedes disk formation, and that the disk begins to form in an environment already enriched with grown dust. The efficiency of dust growth in the disk is limited by dust growth barriers. For dust grains with maximum sizes < 100 micron, electrostatic or bouncing barriers likely dominate, whereas fragmentation and drift barriers are more important for larger grains. The disk midplane quickly becomes enriched with dust, while the vertically integrated dust distribution shows notable local variations around the canonical 1:100 dust-to-gas mass ratio. These positive and negative deviations are likely caused by local hydrodynamic flows, as the globally integrated dust-to-gas ratio deviates negligibly from the initial 1:100 value. We note that care should be taken when using models with fixed dust sizes, as disks exhibit profound negative radial gradients in dust size even during the earliest stages of disk formation. Models with a constant Stokes number may be preferable in this context. Conclusions. Early dust enrichment and growth may facilitate planet formation, as suggested by observations of protoplanetary disk substructures.","published":"2025-05-07T08:37:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame $\\sim3 \\mu$m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI\/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H$\\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.","published":"2025-04-01T18:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The NAP formulated by Tejeda \\& Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH, showing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further application, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a transonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime within the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining a typical single \"saddle-type\" sonic transition, a \"saddle-spiral pair\" is produced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) \"spiral type\" and the outer being a usual \"saddle type.\" The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic radii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason for the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely due to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of velocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics framework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid's energy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that align with the spirit of TR13-like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR hydrodynamics. This could then essentially circumvent GR hydrodynamics or GR magnetohydrodynamics equations.","published":"2025-03-06T10:03:59Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.HE"]}

Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies -- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\\sim {200 - 6000}~\\textrm{M}_\\odot~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\\sim 30$ objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 - 6.4}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques.","published":"2025-10-01T14:02:41Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO"]}

Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many recurrent astronomical events. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is over a wide range, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity in that range, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.","published":"2025-04-03T18:01:04Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.IM"]}

If these offsets are arbitrarily subtracted from the entire DES-SN5YR sample, the preference for evolving dark energy is reduced.

First, 43% of the offset is due to DES-SN5YR improvements in the modelling of supernova intrinsic scatter and host galaxy properties. These are scientifically-motivated modelling updates implemented in DES-SN5YR and their associated uncertainties are captured within the DES-SN5YR systematic error budget. Even if the less accurate scatter model and host properties from Pantheon+ are used instead, the DES-SN5YR evidence for evolving dark energy is only reduced from 3.9$\\sigma$ to 3.3$\\sigma$. Second, 38% of the offset is due to a misleading comparison because different selection functions characterize the DES subsets included in Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR and therefore individual SN distance measurements are expected to be different because of different bias corrections.

Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km\/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations.

Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.","published":"2025-01-16T08:30:19Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.GA"]}

The results from current experiments show they can detect a wide variety of mm transients ranging from Galactic stars to extragalactic sources associated with AGNs and other energetic phenomena, and moving Solar System objects such as asteroids. These results, and theoretical predictions, indicate that future mm\/submm facilities will detect many kinds of transient, including flaring stars, protostars, GRBs, TDEs, neutron star mergers, FBOTs, and SNe. New classes of mm-variable may be uncovered by CMB experiments, and transient searches at other wavelengths, such as the optical LSST survey, will produce additional targets to followup with PRIMA. Predicted rates for extragalactic mm transients to be detected by CMB experiments range from 10s to 1000s of events over the lifetime of these projects. CMB-S4 is most relevant for PRIMA, producing $\\sim$100 extragalactic transients per year. Galactic transients and variable sources will also be detected, but the most common Galactic transients, flaring stars, operate on such short timescales that direct follow-up with PRIMA will not be feasible.

These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.","published":"2025-07-07T16:59:11Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.GA","hep-th"]}

We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe\/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha\/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe\/H] < -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km\/s) than the local-thick disc. ...","published":"2025-07-09T14:04:43Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We test two sets of galaxy stellar mass functions for four populations of galaxies (central\/satellite, blue\/red) and run parameter estimation using Approximate Bayesian Computation over each model when compared to a set of applicable literature models. For the Weigel et al. (2016) (arXiv:1604.00008v1) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\\mu = 11.94^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, $\\sigma = 0.49^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.31^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$.

We examine five properties of the hot gas (the central cooling time, the central electron density, the central entropy excess, the concentration parameter, and the cuspiness) which are commonly used as classification metrics to identify cool core (CC), weak cool core (WCC) and non cool core (NCC) clusters of galaxies. Using mock Chandra X-ray images as inputs, we first explore an unsupervised clustering scheme to see how the resulting groups correlate with the CC\/WCC\/NCC classification based on the different criteria. We observe that the groups replicate almost exactly the separation of the galaxy cluster images when classifying them based on the concentration parameter. We then move on to a regression task, utilizing a ResNet model to predict the value of all five properties. The network is able to achieve a mean percentage error of 1.8% for the central cooling time, and a balanced accuracy of 0.83 on the concentration parameter, making them the best-performing metrics. Finally, we use simulation-based inference (SBI) to extract posterior distributions for the network predictions.

The first of these is a payload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000 keV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The development of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned from the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design. In addition, its development included detailed characterization, space qualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large number of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design. We will present these along with an overview of the readout electronics. These electronics were developed with flexibility in mind, as well as low cost and low power consumption. As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is also used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read out an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a coded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and localization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use gas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy region. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these for wide field of view observations.

In this work, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework designed to meticulously decompose this observed tension into its constituent parts: standard measurement errors, information loss arising from parameter-space projection, and genuine physical tension. Our approach, employing Fisher matrix analysis with MCMC-estimated loss coefficients and explicitly modeling information loss via variance inflation factors ($\\lambda$), is particularly important in high-precision analysis where even seemingly small information losses can impact conclusions. We find that the real tension component ($T_{real}$) has a mean value of 5.94 km\/s\/Mpc (95\\% CI: [3.32, 8.64] km\/s\/Mpc).

To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher.

Our main avenue to probe atmospheric escape is through the near-infrared metastable helium triplet, which has enabled mass loss rate measurements for tens of exoplanets. Among them, only a few studies show evidence for out-of-transit absorption, supporting the presence of a hydrodynamic outflow. However, none of these observations precisely identified the physical extent of the outflow, either due to non-continuous or short-duration observations. This limits our measurements of accurate mass loss rates. Here we present the first continuous, full-orbit helium phase curve monitoring of an exoplanet, the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, obtained with JWST\/NIRISS. It reveals helium absorption for nearly 60% of the orbit at >3sigma significance. Our results show that WASP-121b sustains a strong outflow, separating into two tails trailing and leading the planet. The persistent absorption from these tails, together with their measured radial velocity shifts, suggests that they remain in a collisional fluid regime at large distances from the planet and display very different dynamics. The leading trail has a higher density and moves toward the star, whereas the trailing trail is being pushed away from the star, with the latter being blue-shifted due to stellar irradiation pressure. While qualitatively agreeing with theoretical expectations, the observed structure of helium is not self-consistently reproducible by current models, limiting constraints on the mass loss rate. Furthermore, we show that while ground-based observations of the helium triplet are essential to measure the outflow dynamics precisely, they ideally should be combined with continuous JWST phase curves to constrain the absolute level of helium absorption.","published":"2025-10-10T19:16:17Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\\rm FWHM=270\\pm 15~km\\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\\alpha$, and faint ($\\rm Ly\\alpha=0.07H\\alpha$) compared to Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity.

We discuss that H$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\\alpha$ halos ($\\Delta z<0.02$, $\\Delta r<100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings.

We present the first detection of unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs. $g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius, reaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to identify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived binary fraction of $f_\\mathrm{bin}(q>0.7) = 0.016 \\pm 0.005$ stands in contrast to the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured from HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in globular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and high-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of outstanding questions in star cluster research.

However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical\/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 $deg^2$. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z>3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers {\\eta}<10%.

X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population.

To detect weak features on a strong continuum and reliably measure line fluxes and line-flux ratios, fringe correction is crucial. This paper describes the first of two steps implemented in the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline, which is the division by a static fringe flat that removes the bulk of the fringes for extended sources. Fringe flats were derived by fitting a numerical model to observations of spatially extended sources. The model includes fringes that originate from two resonating cavities in the detector substrate (a third fringe component that originates from the dichroic filters is not included). The model, numerical implementation, and resulting fringe flats are described, and the efficiency of the calibration was evaluated for sources of various spatial extents on the detector. Flight fringe flats are obtained from observations of the planetary nebula NGC 7027. The two fringe components are well recovered and fitted by the model. The derived parameters are used to build a fringe flat for each MRS spectral band, except for 1A and 1B due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of NGC 7027 in these bands. When applied to extended sources, fringe amplitudes are reduced to the sub-percent level on individual spaxels. For point sources, they are reduced to amplitudes of 1 to 5% considering individual spaxels and a single dither position, and decrease to the 1 to 2% level after two-dimensional residual fringe correction. The fringe flats derived from this work are the reference files currently in use by the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline. They provide an efficient calibration for extended sources, and are less efficient for point sources.","published":"2025-04-15T16:02:59Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM"]}

With the development of life detection approaches like searching for atmospheric chemical species indicative of life, chemical disequilibrium has also been proposed as a potentially key signature for life. Chemical disequilibrium can arise from the production of waste gases due to biological processes and can be quantified using a metric known as the available Gibbs free energy. The main goal of this study was to explore the detectability of chemical disequilibrium for a modern Earth-like analog. Atmospheric retrievals coupled to a thermodynamics model were used to determine posterior distributions for the available Gibbs free energy given simulated observations at various noise levels. In reflected light, chemical disequilibrium signals were difficult to detect and limited by the constraints on the CH4 abundance, which was challenging to constrain for a modern Earth case with simulated observations spanning ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths with V-band SNRs of 10, 20, and 40. For a modern Earth analog orbiting a late-type M dwarf, we simulated transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and found that tight constraints on the available Gibbs free energy can be achieved, but only at extremely low noise on the order of several ppm. This study serves as further proof of concept for remotely inferring chemical disequilibrium biosignatures and should be included in continuing to build life detection strategies for future exoplanet characterization missions.","published":"2025-05-22T05:02:48Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

This effect enables the reconstruction of weak lensing convergence $\\hat{\\kappa}$ maps for DES and DECaLS by linearly combining galaxy overdensities across magnitude bins in the $g$, $r$, and $z$ photometry bands \\citep{Qin+,Qin2+}. In this study, we enhance the lensing reconstruction method by addressing biases in the magnification coefficient estimation, which arise from incomplete consideration of selection effects, especially those induced by photometric redshift (photo-$z$) selection. Using a Random Forest-based photo-$z$ estimation for DECaLS and DES galaxies, we quantify the impact of photo-$z$ induced selection on magnification coefficient estimation. Our results show that neglecting photo-$z$ selection introduces significant biases in the magnification coefficient, leading to deviations in the reconstructed convergence map amplitude $A$, with values ranging from 0.4 to 3.5 depending on the survey, redshift, and magnitude cuts. By incorporating an improved magnification coefficient estimation that accounts for photo-$z$ selection, these biases are significantly reduced, with $A$ converging to $\\sim 1$ as the magnitude cuts approach optimal values. This improvement is consistently observed across DES and DECaLS datasets and redshift bins, despite differences in survey strategies and depths.

The efficiency of mass transfer - the fraction of mass retained by the accretor during binary interaction - is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the final fate of these systems. However, this parameter is observationally poorly constrained due to a scarcity of well-characterized post-mass-transfer binaries. Be+sdOB binaries, consisting of a rapidly rotating Be star and a stripped hot subdwarf companion, are particularly valuable for studying mass transfer since they represent clear examples of past binary interaction. Recently, a significantly expanded observational sample of 16 Be+sdOB binaries with well-constrained masses was obtained through combined spectroscopic and interferometric observations. In this work, we compile and analyze this sample to provide robust constraints on the mass transfer efficiency in binaries that underwent stable mass transfer during the donor's hydrogen-shell burning phase. Our analysis reveals that mass transfer was predominantly conservative: half of the systems require mass transfer efficiencies above 50%. This challenges commonly adopted assumptions of highly non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution modeling. Our findings are inconsistent with models that account for spin-up and limit accretion due to a centrifugal barrier. We also find tension with a commonly used mass transfer model in rapid population synthesis that limits accretion based on the thermal timescale of the accretor. These results have strong implications for almost all products of binary evolution including the variety of supernovae, white dwarfs, blue stragglers, runaway stars, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave sources.","published":"2025-05-20T18:00:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.HE"]}

We use a pebble-based thermophysical model of gas-pressure build-up in the subsurface to reproduce the global emission rates of dust, water, CO$_{2}$, and CO observed by Rosetta at comet 67P\/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P). For sufficiently low diffusivities, the low tensile strength is overcome, leading to the ejection of $\\sim$ millimetre- to decimetre-sized dust-particles as well as roughly the correct outgassing rates. All the ejections, and thus the bulk of the outgassing, come from the southern hemisphere during the time that it is strongly illuminated at perihelion. This leads to a 'blow-off' of the dust-crust that otherwise forms: volatiles are much closer to the surface in the south (within the top centimetre) than in the north (10-or-more cm deep), naturally explaining the strong southern water-outgassing expected from 67P's non-gravitational accelerations and torques. We find that low gas-diffusivity, as well as large heat-capacity and steeply decreasing tensile strength with depth or ice-content, are in best agreement with the outgassing data. However, even in these cases, we struggle not to exceed the observed emission rates of dust, CO$_{2}$, and CO. In the south, it is difficult for models to achieve a balance between triggering activity and generating too much of it (with CO$_{2}$ the critical driving-species here); while in the north, it remains challenging to generate activity at all. Strong constraints are placed on the nature of the activity mechanism by the location of dust-ejection and erosion.","published":"2025-07-02T07:57:54Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma exchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar wind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma parameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of heavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a new solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere, capturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including neutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and ionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and into the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link its spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results confirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key mechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic flux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant solar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from coronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces the observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the predicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a population of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and solar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.","published":"2025-04-07T15:23:53Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.plasm-ph","94.30.Nv (Primary) 76X05, 82C20 (Secondary)"]}

JWST is revealing potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres, though their presence is yet to provide strong evidence for life. The central challenge is attribution: how to confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially regarding system-scale stochastic processes that could set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing atmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically define the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for biosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic parameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving star, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from the baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin. We present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in explaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density as a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic counterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative biosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an \"unknown unknown\" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or life as we don't yet know it.","published":"2025-05-02T18:00:49Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

This suggests that ESO 137-001 is at its current stage of ram pressure interaction characterised by an efficient HI stripping, rather than an enhanced conversion of HI to H$_2$, which was recently observed in some other jellyfish galaxies.","published":"2025-01-13T15:36:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-V\\\"{a}is\\\"{a}l\\\"{a} (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\\gtrsim 1.4\\ M_{\\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.","published":"2025-01-13T10:36:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","nucl-th"]}

Classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), low-mass PMS stars actively accreting from a disc, hold a well-described magnetospheric accretion model. Their strong, inclined dipole magnetic fields truncate the disc at a few stellar radii, channelling material along magnetic field lines to fall onto the stellar surface near the dipole pole. However, this paradigm assumes the presence of a single star, and a complete description of the accretion process in multiple systems remains to be achieved. Building on our previous work on DQ Tau and AK Sco, we aim to describe the accretion processes in cTTS binaries, accounting for the influence of stellar magnetic fields. Specifically, we sought to explore how the magnetospheric accretion model of cTTSs can be applied to V4046 Sgr, a spectroscopic binary composed of equal-mass and coeval cTTSs in a circular orbit with synchronous rotation, surrounded by a circumbinary disc. We analysed a time series of ESPaDOnS spectra covering several orbital cycles. A variability analysis was performed on the radial velocities and on the Balmer, He I D3, and Ca II emission lines, which are associated with the accretion process. We identified the secondary as the system's main accretor, operating in an unstable regime. Additionally, we detected an accretion funnel flow connecting the dipole pole of the primary star with a nearby bulk of gas. We concluded that the two components exhibit dissimilar accretion patterns. The primary operates in an \"ordered chaotic\" regime, where accretion funnel flows and accretion tongues coexist. Conversely, the secondary appears to be in a chaotic regime, with accretion tongues dominating.","published":"2025-04-14T13:33:44Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.","published":"2025-08-05T11:03:14Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we analyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong levels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the emission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with well-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are left-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The sources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic electrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone distribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.","published":"2025-05-10T00:29:40Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.plasm-ph","physics.space-ph"]}

In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.","published":"2025-07-03T13:34:36Z","categories":["hep-ph","astro-ph.CO","gr-qc"]}

We measured a projected stellar obliquity of $\\lambda \\approx 180^\\circ$, indicating that the orbit of the HJ is retrograde relative to the direction of the stellar spin. Due to the slow sky-projected rotational velocity of the host star ($v \\sin{i_\\star} \\approx 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$), the true orbit of the HJ could be closer to polar. HJs around stars with effective temperatures below the Kraft break -- such as KELT-23A -- are generally found to have prograde orbits that are well-aligned with the equatorial planes of their host stars (i.e., $\\lambda \\sim 0^\\circ$), most likely due to spin-orbit realignment driven by stellar tidal dissipation. This system is therefore a unique outlier that strains migration and tidal theories. The fact that the HJ has a highly misaligned orbit may suggest that the planet arrived at its close-in orbit relatively recently, possibly via interactions with the wide-separation (570 AU) M-dwarf companion in the system, or that it has stalled near an antialigned or polar orientation while realigning.

In this study, we demonstrate that cool starspots systematically distort spectral morphology and bias the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and luminosities derived for non-accreting Weak-Lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS). Using a sample of 56 WTTS with high-resolution, broad-band X-Shooter spectra, we perform two-temperature spectral fits that explicitly account for spot coverages and temperature contrasts. These composite models consistently outperform traditional single-temperature fits, particularly in the 3350-4000 K regime, where spot contributions dominate the red-optical and near-infrared flux. Moreover, we propose that surface gravity discrepancies between optical and infrared measurements are a natural consequence of spot-dominated emission in PMS stars. We find that single-temperature models can overestimate effective temperatures by up to 700 K and underestimate log g by 1-2 dex. Using spot-corrected effective temperatures, we derive masses and ages from traditional, magnetic, and spotted evolutionary models, finding that spot-corrections systematically raise inferred masses by up to 80% and stellar ages by up to 0.5 dex. These discrepancies are strongest for stars in the 0.3-0.8 solar mass range. Using starspots as a proxy for magnetic topology, we find evidence that a shift from largely axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric magnetic fields dominated by small-scale structures coincides with the formation of a radiative core during PMS evolution, effectively distinguishing between the convective and interface dynamo regimes.","published":"2025-05-16T04:10:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

However, direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution during star and planet formation. We derived 12C\/13C ratios from the isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the warm gas towards seven Class 0\/I protostellar systems to improve our understanding of the evolution of the 12C\/13C ratios during star and planet formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit the 12C\/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C\/13C ratios are set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also implies that low 12C\/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C\/13C ratios in protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.","published":"2025-05-27T15:07:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Remarkably, we find that this can be achieved with non-minimal couplings $\\xi < 1$, in contrast to the large values typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any unitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale.

Additionally, sulfides show enrichment in Mg and Ca, up to 22 and 13 wt\\% respectively, the main remaining cations being Fe, Cr, and Mn.

However, current data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or too axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the pulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of existing asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is also stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic field), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components which remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase relationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases absolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive observational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for mode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this effect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase information should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches for oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of currently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence and compact pulsators.","published":"2025-05-06T04:27:57Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\\acute{\\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe\/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.","published":"2025-10-08T05:35:41Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We also report the HI properties for 89 cluster members detected with MeerKAT. A color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a bimodal distribution typical of a cluster population, more evolved than those found in isolation. We combine optical H${\\alpha}$ and WISE infrared data to compare the star formation history at two distinct timescales. Differences in the star forming activity depicted by both populations manifest as starburst in 24 found members. Of these, 18 starburst galaxies have neutral gas measurements, and show disturbed HI disks that suggest an environmentally-triggered boost in star formation within the last 10$^7$ yrs. Processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions may underlie their enhanced star-forming activity and asymmetric disks. Since Hydra's dynamical history is unclear, we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of the sample. We reveal a possible link between the large scale structure feeding the Hydra I cluster and the heightened star-forming activity of the starburst galaxies. This feeding pattern matches the few substructure that has been identified in Hydra in previous works, and may explain its origin. Our results portray a picture of a cluster with an evolved nature, plus a population of new infalling galaxies that manifest the impact of their first contact with the cluster environment through star formation, color, morphology and gas content transformations.","published":"2025-10-11T13:58:51Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Re-entry objects, particularly sample return capsules (SRCs) such as the one from the Hayabusa2 mission, behave similarly to slow meteors during atmospheric entry and provide valuable insights into natural fireball events. In this study, we initially analyse seismic signals from the Hayabusa2 SRC re-entry, which took place on December 5, 2020, over South Australia. The SRC's signature was captured by a dense network of seismic stations (Eakin, 2018; O'Donnell et al., 2020), offering a unique opportunity to investigate the signals' characteristics and verify their connection to the re-entry event. The ballistic trajectory was confirmed as the source shock mechanism for this event. We isolate this signal and use it as a reference for a ballistic shock signature and compare it to three other fireball case studies, including a suborbital re-entry and two natural meteoroids. Although factors such as local geology and atmospheric conditions were not considered in this preliminary study, our results show promise, with high correlations for events with purely ballistic trajectories and lower correlations for those involving fragmentation or airbursts. This implies that seismic data may be able to disambiguate whether any particular fireball event underwent significant fragmentation or airburst, key phenomena for assessing body strengths.","published":"2025-05-21T23:15:53Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","physics.geo-ph"]}

However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM\/Resolve spectrum of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak, neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\\alpha,1}$ and K$_{\\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to an inner emission radius of ${\\rm r} \\geq 2.7\\times 10^{4}~GM\/c^{2}$ for likely inclinations.

Each atmosphere uniquely influences the likelihood of surface liquid water, defining the habitable zone (HZ), the region around a star where liquid water can exist. However, being within the HZ does not guarantee habitability, as life requires more than just liquid water. In this study, we adopted a two-pronged approach. First, we estimated the surface conditions of planets near the HZ's inner edge under various atmospheric compositions. By utilizing a 3D climate model, we refined the inner boundaries of the HZ for planets with atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2 for the first time. Second, we investigated microbial survival in these environments, conducting laboratory experiments on the growth and survival of E. coli K-12, focusing on the impact of different gas compositions. This innovative combination of climate modeling and biological experiments bridges theoretical climate predictions with biological outcomes. Our findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.","published":"2025-01-09T15:01:17Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800-4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\\pm6)\\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1% for the Galaxy.","published":"2025-04-02T19:50:17Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"]}

On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.","published":"2025-08-05T09:28:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc"]}

By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik 41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening, metallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods, where parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained from both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the derived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential degeneracies.

These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim1.5\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved.

We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.","published":"2025-05-09T08:15:59Z","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.SR"]}

This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR $n$ at z>1 (but not at z<1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At $z>1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$ is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles.

In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation.

However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.","published":"2025-10-07T18:00:03Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.HE"]}

However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a \"fixed-planet\" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.","published":"2025-03-03T17:07:33Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.SR"]}

The impact on the evolution of the invisible planetesimal population is still limitedly studied, yet mounting evidence from the Solar System shows how the appearance of its giant planets played a key role in shaping the habitability of the terrestrial planets. We investigate the dynamical and collisional transport processes of volatile elements by planetesimals in protoplanetary disks that host young giant planets using the HD163296 system as our case study. HD163296 is one of the best characterised protoplanetary disks that has been proposed to host at least four giant planets on wide orbits as well as a massive planetesimal disk. The formation of giant planets in the HD163296 system creates a large population of dynamically excited planetesimals, the majority of which originate from beyond the CO snowline. The excited planetesimals are both transported to the inner disk regions and scattered outward beyond the protoplanetary disk and into interstellar space. Existing solid planets can be enriched in volatile elements to levels comparable or larger than those of the Earth, while giant planets can be enriched to the levels of Jupiter and Saturn. The formation of giant planets on wide orbits impacts the compositional evolution of protoplanetary disks and young planetary bodies on a global scale. The collisional enrichment of the atmospheres of giant planets can alter or mask the signatures of their formation environments, but can provide independent constraints on the disk mass. Protoplanetary disks with giant planets on wide orbits prove efficient factories of interstellar objects.","published":"2025-03-06T18:00:59Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.GA"]}

Identification of radio-luminous AGN from this LoTSS source catalogue is not only important from the point of view of understanding the accretion history of the universe, but also enables a wide range of other science. However, at present the vast majority of the optical identifications lack spectroscopic information or well-sampled spectral energy distributions. We show that colour and absolute magnitude information from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) allows for the robust and efficient selection of radio AGN candidates, generating a radio AGN candidate sample of around 600,000 objects with flux density $> 1.1$ mJy, spanning 144-MHz luminosities between $10^{21}$ and $10^{29}$ W Hz$^{-1}$.

This work tests the predictions of the DIANOGA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster progenitors at z=2.2, comparing them with observations, and investigates the environmental effects on galaxies by comparing protoclusters with an average volume of the Universe. We analyze 14 protoclusters and a cosmological box of 49 cMpc\/h per side. We compare predictions and observations of the galaxy properties, including colors of galaxies obtained with radiative transfer, to analyze UVJ diagrams. We showed that the DIANOGA simulations produce a galaxy stellar mass function in broad agreement with observations, with a higher fraction of high-mass galaxies ($M_{\\ast}>10^{10} \\ M_{\\odot}$) in massive halos in protoclusters, compared to the box. The same signal, with lower significance, is also observed in the wide-field protocluster structures, indicating an accelerated evolution of galaxies before their infall into massive halos. Our simulations underestimate SFRs of galaxies both in protoclusters and in the box, compared to observations, due to low gas reservoirs. We find a weak suppression of SFRs in protocluster galaxies (~0.05 dex), compared to the box, increasing up to ~0.25 dex in massive halos. The quenched galaxy fraction varies significantly across different protocluster halos, consistent with observations. The simulations show a strong dependence of quenched fractions on halo mass and an excess of quenched galaxies in the wide-field protocluster region, compared to the cosmological box.

We present here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic data, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry models and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust, optimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario to explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based chemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral absorption at 4.1 $\\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and the other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, Na and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a temperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands. In addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features observed by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\\mu$m. While we advocate the need for more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results for WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric retrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next generation of transit spectroscopy.","published":"2025-04-10T15:01:28Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.","published":"2025-04-07T18:00:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

High contrast imagers have resolved dozens of circumstellar disks with scattered light polarimetric imaging. Many of these detections are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, demonstrating it to be a rich sample for investigating planetary system architectures and planet-disk interactions. With the goal of expanding the sample of directly imaged debris disks in Scorpius-Centaurus, we conducted the Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) leveraging knowledge of high-IR excesses and the power of high contrast polarimetric differential imaging. In combination with the GPIES polarimetric disk survey, we observe seven new Scorpius-Centaurus targets to achieve a 60% complete survey of debris disks with IR excesses exceeding $2.5\\times10^{-4}$, resolving four new debris disks. HD 98363, HD 109832, and HD 146181 are resolved for the first time, and HD 112810 is resolved for the first time in polarized intensity.

As a part of this long-term modulation in solar activity, the decennial rhythm occasionally breaks, with quiescent phases with very few sunspots observed over multiple decades. These episodes are termed as solar grand minima. Observation of solar magnetic activity proxies complemented by solar dynamo simulations suggests that the large-scale solar polar fields become very weak during these minima phases with a temporary halt in the polar field reversal. Eventually, with the accumulation of sufficient polar fluxes, the polarity reversal and regular cyclic activity is thought to resume, Using multi-millennial dynamo simulations with stochastic forcing, we quantify the polar flux threshold necessary to recover global solar polarity reversal and surmount grand minima phases. We find that the duration of a grand minimum is independent of the onset rate and does not affect the recovery rate. Our results suggest a method to forecast the Sun's recovery from a grand minima phase. However, based on our approach, we could not identify specific precursors that signal entry in to a grand minima phase -- implying that predicting the onset of grand minima remains an outstanding challenge.","published":"2025-05-13T09:24:53Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.","published":"2025-06-03T03:40:08Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA","hep-ph","hep-th"]}

Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark.

It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their status, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC database. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its applications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's artificial satellites.   Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of geocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified. In the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was made in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which clear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work.   For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to change their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was proposed to leave their status unchanged.   Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that repeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the past. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the MDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this and our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available on the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid data with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their classification.","published":"2025-04-03T08:37:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\\sim15\\,M_\\odot$\/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $<12\\,M_\\odot$\/yr.

Discrete stellar kinematics probe the mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar metallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have distinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by discrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using discrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to discrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus a background component or as two populations plus a background that represents the bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential against a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter, or a radially varying mass-to-light ratio.

Although measurements exist for over 200 planets, the overall distribution of these angles is not fully understood, motivating further observations across the full parameter space.

Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a GC luminosity function peak at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of 11 individual GCs, finding them to be old ($> 9$ Gyr) and with a range of metallicities from [M\/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M\/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc), we derived photometric GC masses and find that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and find $\\sigma_\\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\\sigma_\\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$ when the GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S\/N spectrum is considered an interloper. We discuss the possible origin of NGC1502-DF2, taking the lower distance, spread in GC metallicities, flat stellar population profiles, and dynamical mass estimate into consideration.","published":"2025-03-05T11:30:49Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The normalised cumulative rank (NCR) method was used to compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions of their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars. The resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha} = 0.170 \\pm 0.076$ is low, while the NCR$_{\\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value of $0.488 \\pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is consistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the small sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue variables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction between an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is likely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope ejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar merger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR results. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve maximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars and LRNe.

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.","published":"2025-07-02T17:49:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM","astro-ph.SR","cs.AI","cs.LG"]}

While both radiative absorption and Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric species can contribute to this effect, the role of the scattering in suppressing thermal radiation from magma oceans remains unclear. In this study, we developed a 1-D radiative transfer model for planetary and solar radiation in a proto-atmosphere composed of H2O and H2, and a coupled thermal evolution model of a planetary interior and proto-atmosphere, to investigate the scattering blanketing effect on planetary radiation and magma ocean cooling. Our results show that Rayleigh scattering significantly reduces outgoing planetary radiation at wavelengths below ~1 micrometer, particularly in hot, thick atmospheres where scattering is highly effective. Consequently, the planetary outgoing radiation flux decreases by up to about one to two orders of magnitude, and the magma ocean lifetime is prolonged by up to about three times due to the scattering blanketing effect when the total amounts of H2O and H2 are equivalent to or greater than the present-day terrestrial seawater. These findings suggest that the prolonged magma ocean phase facilitated efficient differentiation between compatible and incompatible elements, even in the lower mantle. Furthermore, they imply that sustained magma oceans likely persisted throughout much of the giant impact phase, supporting a magma ocean origin of the Moon consistent with its observed chemical characteristics.","published":"2025-04-02T02:55:07Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","physics.ao-ph","physics.geo-ph"]}

Typically, effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$), surface gravity (${\\rm log}\\ g$) and metallicity ([M\/H]) are derived from stellar spectra, then $M$, $L$ and stellar age ($t$) can be obtained by interpolating in the grid of stellar evolutionary models.

The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the main-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is $32\\%$ and $9\\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that achieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also aligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\\%$. The prediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44 Gyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric parameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\\rm i}$ are $29\\%$, $7\\%$, $36\\%$ and $7\\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity on these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the greatest impact on $t$.

The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60). Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$), all reducing to the Schwarzschild case in the limit $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. Our results show that the DM halo modifies essential BH features, such as the event horizon radius and spacetime curvature, as reflected in the Kretschmann scalar. We also derive an approximate analytical expression for the BH shadow radius, which increases slightly due to the halo's influence. Comparisons with two observational datasets further validate the analysis. Thermodynamic properties are examined across the two models. In the first, a generalized Smarr formula is obtained via two additional variables, $\\gamma$ and $a$. The second incorporates halo effects through $V_c=0$ and $a=0$.

During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.","published":"2025-05-23T12:03:58Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc","hep-th"]}

Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP\/FXT observations suggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered: two-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model with energy injection. Both three provide reasonable explanations. The two-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small initial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the forward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model, EP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed on-axis.

Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies.

The challenge for MXT, and possibly for future missions with similar mass and mechanical constraints, is to maintain spectral performance all along the mission duration. To assess the expected radiation-induced performance degradation, a spare flight model of MXT focal plane underwent an irradiation campaign with 50 MeV protons at the Arronax cyclotron facility in June 2022.

These planets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry, transmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal information about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics.   Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a more comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully capture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We identify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when irradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium.   Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary rotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows, though less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause both eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat redistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend strongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes.   These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR phase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot shifts.

AAS2RTO is currently configured to work primarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), distributed by certified LSST community brokers. We provide an example of how AAS2RTO can be used by defining a set of criteria to prioritise observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) close to peak brightness, in preparation for observations with the spectrograph at the Danish-1.54m telescope. Using a sample of archival alerts from ZTF, we evaluate the criteria we have designed to estimate the number of SNe Ia that we will be able to observe with a 1.5m telescope. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our criteria when applied to mock LSST observations of SNe Ia.","published":"2025-01-12T22:55:32Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM"]}

The impact of N$_2$O   on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres","abstract":"Molecular oxygen (O2) will be an important molecule in the search for biosignatures in terrestrial planetary atmospheres in the coming decades. In particular, O2 combined with a reducing gas is thought to be strong evidence for disequilibrium caused by surface life. However, there are circumstances where it would be very difficult or impossible to detect O2, in which cases it has been suggested that ozone (O3), the photochemical product of O2, could be used instead. Unfortunately, the O2-O3 relationship is highly nonlinear and dependent on the host star, as shown in detail in the first paper in this series. We explore the O2-O3 relationship around G0V-M5V host stars, using climate\/photochemistry modeling to simulate atmospheres while varying abundances of O2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is of particular importance to the O2-O3 relationship not just because it is produced biologically, but because it is the primary source of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which fuel the NOx catalytic cycle which destroys O3, and the smog mechanism that produces O3. We vary the O2 mixing ratio from 0.01-150% present atmospheric level (PAL), and N2O abundances of 10% and 1000% PAL. We find that varying N2O impacts the O2-O3 relationship differently depending strongly on both the host star and the amount of atmospheric O2. Planets orbiting hotter hosts with strong UV fluxes efficiently convert N2O into NOx, often depleting a significant amount of O3 via faster NOx catalytic cycles. However, for cooler hosts and low O2 levels we find that increasing N2O can lead to an increase of overall O3 due to the smog mechanism producing O3 in the lower atmosphere. Variations in O3 result in significant changes in the amount of harmful UV reaching the surfaces of the model planets as well as the strength of the 9.6 $\\mu$m O3 emission spectral feature, demonstrating potential impacts on habitability and future observations.","published":"2025-05-29T09:25:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

We measured the three multipole moments (monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole, $\\ell = 0, 2, 4$) of the power spectrum of a subset of the CODEX clusters. To fully model cluster clustering, we also determined the expected clustering bias of the sample using estimates for the cluster masses and a mass-to-bias model calibrated using N-body simulations. We estimated the covariance matrix of the measured power spectrum multipoles using a set of simulated dark-matter halo catalogs. Combining all these ingredients, we performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of cosmological parameters $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$ to obtain their posterior. Results. We found the CODEX clustering signal to be consistent with an earlier X-ray selected cluster sample, the REFLEX II sample.

We present a 4D variational assimilation technique applied for the first time to real solar data. Our method is tested against observations of past cycles 22, 23, 24 and on the ongoing cycle 25 for which we give an estimate of the imminent maximum value and timing and also provide a first forecast of the next solar minimum. We use a variational data assimilation technique applied to a solar mean-field Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo model. Ensemble predictions are produced in order to obtain uncertainties on the timing and value of the maximum of cycle $n+1$, when data on cycle $n$ is assimilated. We study in particular the influence of the phase during which data is assimilated in the model and of the weighting of various terms in the objective function. The method is validated on cycles 22, 23 and 24 with very satisfactory results. For cycle 25, predictions vary depending on the extent of the assimilation window but start converging past 2022 to a solar maximum reached between mid-2024 up to the beginning of 2025 with a sunspot number value of $143.1 \\pm 15.0$. Relatively close values of the maximum are found in both hemispheres within a time lag of a few months. We also forecast a next minimum around late 2029, with still significant errorbars.

As a long-term energy source for ongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a way to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We simulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved interior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation of tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our calculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling, tidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the `radiation-tide-rheology feedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and yet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans to Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this negative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's initial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit and instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where tidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were to have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be induced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy transport.","published":"2025-05-06T15:04:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure.

Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.","published":"2025-09-02T18:00:03Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"]}

We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases, whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.","published":"2025-05-20T07:31:15Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.GA"]}

In this work, we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for modeling the mixing of binary gas species. The model treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler equations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms derived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The numerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined with a two-step Euler integrator. In this setup, the hydrodynamic evolution is first computed using standard SPH techniques to handle pressure forces. This is followed by a separate correction step that accounts for interspecies collisional exchanges. Such a decoupled treatment enables the use of a larger timestep dictated by hydrodynamics rather than the typically much smaller collisional timescale, enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves good accuracy in reproducing the equilibration of density and temperature in a range of molecular mass ratios. Its modular structure supports natural extensions to polyatomic mixtures and enables the inclusion of additional physics, such as gas-solid interactions with dust and ice. These features make the method particularly well-suited for applications involving confined, multi-component gas systems, such as those expected during the ESA ExoMars mission.","published":"2025-09-08T11:59:26Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

The images were processed for low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for instrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using wavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and satellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each component. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400 kpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%, respectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members (M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence. These results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a dominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are analysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly exceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an instantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, consistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario where SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving the BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of pre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the current injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional mechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over cosmic times.","published":"2025-04-02T08:10:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Four of these were observed as part of the MHONGOOSE survey. We characterise their main HI properties and compare these with synthetic HI data from a sample of 25 similarly massive star-forming galaxies from the TNG50 (20) and FIRE-2 (5) suites of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Globally, the simulated systems have HI and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) masses in good agreement with the observations, but only when the H$_2$ recipe of Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006) is employed. The other recipes that we tested overestimate the H$_2$-to-HI mass fraction by up to an order of magnitude. On a local scale, we find two main discrepancies between observed and simulated data. First, the simulated galaxies show a more irregular HI morphology than the observed ones due to the presence of HI with column density $<10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ up to ~100 kpc from the galaxy centre, in spite of the fact that they inhabit more isolated environments than the observed targets. Second, the simulated galaxies and in particular those from the FIRE-2 suite, feature more complex and overall broader HI line profiles than the observed ones. We interpret this as being due to the combined effect of stellar feedback and gas accretion, which lead to a large-scale gas circulation that is more vigorous than in the observed galaxies. Our results indicate that, with respect to the simulations, gentler processes of gas inflows and outflows are at work in the nearby Universe, leading to more regular and less turbulent HI discs.","published":"2025-03-05T19:00:01Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

This process plays a crucial role in the energy release during solar transient events, which are often associated with electric current sheets (CSs). The CSs can often disintegrate through the development of the tearing instability, which may lead to the formation of plasmoids in the non-linear phase of evolution. However, the complexity of the dynamics, and the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution due to the coalescence of the plasmoids are not fully understood. We used a resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 2.5D current layer embedded in a stratified medium in the solar corona, incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction. Multiple levels of adaptive mesh-refined grids are used to resolve the fine structures that result during the evolution of the system. The instability in the CS is triggered by imposing impulsive velocity perturbations concentrated at three different locations in the upper half along the CS plane; this leads to the formation of plasmoids and their later coalescence. We demonstrate that a transition from purely 2D reconnection to 2D reconnection with guide field takes place at the interface between the plasmoids as the latter evolve from the pre-merger to the merged state. The small-scale, short-lived, and collimated outflows during the merging process share various physical properties with the recently discovered nanojets. The subsequent thermodynamic change within and outside the merged plasmoid region is governed by the combined effect of Ohmic heating, thermal conduction, and expansion\/contraction of the plasma. Our results imply that impulsive perturbations in coronal CSs can be the triggering agents for plasmoid coalescence, which leads to the subsequent magnetic, and thermodynamic change in and around the CS.","published":"2025-05-05T15:33:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","physics.plasm-ph"]}

We construct a sample of X-ray-detected DOGs in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field and examine their X-ray statistical properties. By using Subaru\/HSC SSP, VIKING, and WISE all-sky surveys, our results reveal the discovery of 5738 IR-bright DOGs in the footprint covered by both of the eFEDS and VIKING surveys (60 deg^2), with 65 objects identified as X-ray-detected DOGs (eFEDS-DOGs). Among them, 41 eFEDS-DOGs show a power-law slope in the near to mid-IR bands (power-law DOGs), indicating dust-obscured AGN.

Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (< 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (< 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies.

When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\\log \\rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe\/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.","published":"2025-10-10T13:20:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM","astro-ph.SR","cs.AI"]}

Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band data and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3, 9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties of the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and heated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model the 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference framework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges. The framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of derived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of the CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at redshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged ionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas temperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region $\\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$). The 68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more than 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible interval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior range. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts. The models disfavoured by the LOFAR upper limits are extreme ones, as they are mainly driven by rare and large ionized or heated regions.","published":"2025-05-01T07:56:08Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre\/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\\approx 10^{9}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.","published":"2025-08-04T18:00:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

In this study, we develop a strategy for estimating stellar mass using SPHEREx by examining the dependence on different stellar population synthesis (SPS) models and proposing new scaling relations based on simulated SPHEREx data. We estimate the resolved stellar masses of 19 nearby late-type galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, treating these as fiducial masses. By testing four SPS models covering infrared wavelengths, i.e., E-MILES, Bruzual \\& Charlot 2003 (BC03), Charlot \\& Bruzual 2019 (CB19), and FSPS, we find systematic differences in mass-to-light ratios at $3.6~{\\rm \\mu m}$ ($M_{\\ast}\/L_{\\rm 3.6\\mu m}$) among the SPS models. In particular, BC03 and CB19 yield mass-to-light ratios on average $\\sim0.2-0.3~{\\rm dex}$ lower than those from E-MILES and FSPS.

The mechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type galaxies that are present and active at $z>1.5$ as revealed by JWST\/NIRCam. The process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes (heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\\approx10-30$) orbital periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields, show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open, transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals in star-forming galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$ across the redshifts where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.","published":"2025-09-02T21:31:54Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

However, the factors that determine a dust devil's diameter $D$ and how it might relate to ambient conditions have remained unclear. Moreover, estimating the contribution to an atmospheric dust budget from a population of dust devils with a range of diameters requires an accurate assessment of the differential diameter distribution, but considerable work has yet to reveal the best representation or explain its physical basis. In this study, we propose that this distribution follows a power-law $\\propto D^{-5\/3}$ and provide a simple physical explanation for why the distribution takes this form. By fitting diameter distributions of martian dust devil diameters reported in several studies, we show that the data from several studies support this proposed form.

Here, we showcase results from 46 hours of follow-up observations of PSR J0901$-$4046 using the MeerKAT, Murriyang, GMRT, and MWA radio telescopes. We demonstrate the intriguing stability of the source's timing solution over more than three years, leading to an RMS arrival-time uncertainty of just $\\sim$10$^{-4}$ of the rotation period. Furthermore, non-detection below 500 MHz may indicate a low-frequency turnover in the source's spectrum, while no secular decline in the flux density of the source over time, as was apparent from previous observations, has been observed. Using high time-resolution MeerKAT data, we demonstrate two distinct quasi-periodic oscillation modes present in single pulses, with characteristic time scales of 73 ms and 21 ms. We also observe a statistically significant change in the relative prevalence of distinct pulse morphologies compared to previous observations, possibly indicating a shift in the magnetospheric composition over time.

Short-duration gamma-ray bursts","abstract":"The mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) binaries have long been linked to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found outside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to supernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar population. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce and interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using realistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the host galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis, and simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the BPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and observed offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy types, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of the SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS progenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only) progenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit compared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing different kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement when including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%, while lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that Pch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use of less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts, the predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch threshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing galaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.","published":"2025-04-07T08:31:12Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.GA"]}

We see evidence for stochastic episodes of star formation for all the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies, providing a temporal boosting of UV luminosity in short timescales.

To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments.

The initial release of Virga also assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which include the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as a function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from Solar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies suggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to idealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in microphysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for dynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate particles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case study using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized, aerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate particles. We choose KCl to most directly explore comparisons to previous studies. We demonstrate 1) how our method compares to previous fractal aggregate particle treatments and 2) how our new fractal treatment affects theoretical spectra of cloudy atmospheres.

The pulses from J1634+44 follow a particular pattern, with two pulses being produced every five periods after a waiting time of two or three periods. This pattern could be a result of spin-orbit coupling in a binary system with a 5:2 or 5:3 resonance, where a companion induces beamed radio emission on the white dwarf. The companion is most likely an ultracool dwarf or another white dwarf, making J1634+44 unique among the currently known sample of LPTs.","published":"2025-07-07T15:04:10Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.SR"]}

In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.","published":"2025-01-07T00:10:13Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc","hep-th"]}

Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $< V_R >$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $<V_R>$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated $N$-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the thin\/thick disc stars; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of $m = 4$ Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger ($\\sim 35-45$ percent) when compared with their true values. We showed that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates that the quadrupole structure in Gaia data is likely a result of dominant Gaia parallax errors\/biases, almost masking the true inherent signature of the MW bar.","published":"2025-04-08T18:01:15Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

In particular, the streaming instability (SI) is well recognized as the mechanism for planetesimal formation out of this interaction. The outer region of PPDs is likely subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk turbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust stirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through the Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust concentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to conduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D global simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is weakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of initial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal flows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy, suppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances dust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to assess dust clumping.","published":"2025-03-03T15:30:49Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

Our model can determine the fundamental physical parameters, including temperature and mass ratios, orbital inclination, potential, fillout factor, primary and secondary luminosities and radii, third light contribution, and spot parameters. Notably, unlike previous works, our model can simultaneously process multiple-band light curves and the four parameters of a starspot.

We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1\/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$.

This is likely due to the scarcity of wide-field, high angular resolution, UV surveys of stellar populations with reliable distances and extinction estimates. To address this, we present the Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Clouds Survey (SUMS) catalog.

We assess the potential contamination from other UV excess systems and argue the dominant uncertainty to be dust: early main-sequence stars can mimic the colors of stripped star binaries when extinction is overcorrected.

The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar cycles.   In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near Earth.   We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with the sunspot number and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, as expected, confirming its emission mechanism. In contrast, the extended component exhibits a more complex variation: despite an initial anticorrelation with the sunspot number, we find neither anticorrelation with the sunspot number nor correlation with cosmic-ray electrons over the full 15-year period. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and may differ for electrons and protons or, alternatively, that there is an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.

The second glitch exhibited an exponential recovery process, with $Q = 0.0090(3)$ and $\\tau_{\\rm d} = 45(3)$ days. Additionally, with FAST high-sensitivity observations, we measured the interstellar rotation measure (RM) and the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the spin axis for the first time, and updated the dispersion measure (DM) of PSR J0002+6216. Currently, no variations in RM or DM have been detected. By combining the measured RM with the observed position angle of the spin axis, we determined that the intrinsic position angle of the pulsar's spin axis is $\\psi_{0}(\\text{intrinsic}) = 89.9^{\\circ} \\pm 4.6^{\\circ}$. When we compared this with the proper motion position angle obtained from VLBI, we found a misalignment of approximately 23$^{\\circ}$ between the spin and velocity angles of PSR J0002+6216. At present, pulsars with 2D spin-velocity angle measurements are unable to fully test the Janka et al.(2022) model. However, with more high-precision observational data in the future, we will be able to further test models related to pulsar birth.","published":"2025-04-01T05:13:27Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

To explore this complex subject more thoroughly, we conduct a spectral analysis on 18 GRBs with a main and a second burst observed by Fermi\/GBM. First, we employ Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis to compare the spectral components of the main and the second burst, finding that $83.3\\%$ of the main and second bursts contain a thermal component. $67\\%$ of the GRBs, the thermal component gradually decreased from the main to the second burst and the number of spectra exceeding the \"Synchrotron line-of-death\" is significantly higher in the main burst than in the second burst.

Moreover, from the perspective of the temporal evolution of characteristic radii, the transition from the main to the second burst appeared to be seamless. Finally, we find that both the main and the second burst follow the same Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. Our analysis strongly indicates that the second burst is a continuation of the main burst and is highly likely to share a common physical origin.","published":"2025-05-09T12:44:54Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

Flux Transport Parameter","abstract":"The multi-scale structure of the solar surface magnetic field is essential for understanding both the Sun's internal dynamo processes and its external magnetic activity. The surface flux transport (SFT) model has been successful in describing the large-scale evolution of the surface field, but its ability to capture observed multi-scale features, quantified by magnetic power spectra, remains uncertain. Here, we evaluate the SFT model by comparing observed and simulated power spectra across a broad range of spatial scales and by analyzing the effects of key transport parameters. We find that the simulations reproduce the observed spectra well at spherical harmonic degrees $l\\lesssim60$, but diverge progressively at smaller spatial scales $l\\gtrsim60$. This divergence likely arises from the diffusion approximation used to model the random walk of supergranulation. Power at $20 \\lesssim l \\lesssim 60$ is primarily determined by the magnetic flux sources, while at $l \\lesssim 20$, the spectra are more sensitive to transport parameters. The meridional flow profile, including its equatorial gradient, peak latitude, and polar distribution, along with turbulent diffusivity, has distinct impacts on the low-degree modes ($l \\leq 5$). In particular, a comparison of the $l$=3 and $l$=5 multipoles strengths suggests that the poleward flow above $\\sim\\pm60^\\circ$ latitudes is very weak. This study presents the first quantitative validation of SFT models using magnetic power spectra and provides new constraints on surface flux transport physics.","published":"2025-09-07T09:29:19Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain the nature of Liller 1.

Furthermore, we find the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\\sigma$ level from that of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge. Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.","published":"2025-10-08T18:08:18Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

The resulting LF ($\\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\\alpha<-2$), indicating a lower number density of low H$\\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the H$\\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]\/H$\\beta$, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF.

We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.","published":"2025-06-06T15:10:56Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

However, direct measurements of the polar field is only available since the 1970s. The chromospheric Ca II K polar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network regions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for polar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly calibrated, rotation-corrected Ca II K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1904-2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (2000-2022). We use both of those Ca II K archives to identify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold segmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the archives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from WSO (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.93) and the derived polar field based on an Advective Flux Transport Model (r > 0.91). The PNI series also shows a significant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson Observatory observations (r > 0.87) for both KoSO and Rome-PSPT data. Finally, we use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic field over a 119-year-long period, which includes last 11 solar cycles (Cycle 14-24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in 13-month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar field at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the ongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.","published":"2025-02-03T14:02:55Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR"]}

Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst others, the system's age.

We explore the interrelationships between key galaxy properties associated with star formation, with a particular focus on the impact of dark matter halos. Given the sensitivity of atomic hydrogen (HI) to external processes, we concentrate exclusively on central spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio ($M_{\\rm H_2}\/M_{\\rm HI}$) strongly depends on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR). In the star formation efficiency (SFE)-sSFR plane, most galaxies fall below the H$_2$ fundamental formation relation (FFR), with SFE$_{\\rm HI}$ being consistently lower than SFE$_{\\rm H_2}$. Using the improved halo masses derived by Zhao et al. (2025), for star-forming galaxies, both SFE$_{\\rm HI}$ and $M_{\\rm H_2}\/M_{\\rm HI}$ increase rapidly and monotonically with halo mass, indicating a higher efficiency in converting HI to H$_2$ in more massive halos. This trend ultimately leads to the unsustainable state where SFE$_{\\rm HI}$ exceeds SFE$_{\\rm H_2}$ at halo mass around $10^{12} \\hbox{$M_{\\odot}$}$. For halos with masses exceeding $10^{12} \\hbox{$M_{\\odot}$}$, galaxies predominantly experience quenching. We propose a plausible evolutionary scenario in which the growth of halo mass regulates the conversion of HI to H$_2$, star formation, and the eventual quenching of galaxies. The disk size, primarily regulated by the mass, spin and concentration of the dark matter halo, also significantly influences HI to H$_2$ conversion and star formation. These findings underscore the critical role of dark matter halos as a global regulator of galaxy-wide star formation, a key factor that has been largely underappreciated in previous studies.","published":"2025-03-06T09:25:26Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfv\\'en waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfv\\'en waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfv\\'en waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfv\\'en waves.","published":"2025-05-27T14:43:34Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","physics.geo-ph"]}

External systematic uncertainties","abstract":"The masses of white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate polars (IPs) can be determined from the shape of their hard X-ray spectra. Here we study the importance of all possible systematic uncertainties in this X-ray spectroscopy method, including finite radii and rotation of magnetospheres, finite accretion column height and accretion-flow inclination relative to the WD surface. We also investigate the importance of accretion-heated envelopes on WD surfaces in IPs which are increasing WD radii. Their presence changes the commonly used mass-radius relation for cold white dwarfs. As a first approximation we use thick ($10^{-4}M_\\odot$) hydrogen envelope models with a surface temperature of 30 kK. We present a new model grid of hard X-ray spectra of high-luminous IPs computed among other things with using a new mass-radius relation. This grid is used for fitting Swift\/BAT spectra of 47 IPs. The average WD mass in this sample is 0.82 $M_\\odot$ and coincides with the average WD mass in cataclysmic variables obtained by optical methods. This means that the calculated hard X-ray spectra and the assumptions made that the magnetospheric radii in IPs are close to the corotation radii, and the relative heights of the accretion columns are small are basically correct, because most IPs have high luminosities. But this universal grid (as well as previous universal grids) cannot give correct results for the low-luminous IPs with probably relatively tall accretion columns on the WD surfaces. Such IPs have to be investigated with individual accretion column models.","published":"2025-06-04T08:42:36Z","categories":["astro-ph.SR","astro-ph.HE"]}

Detectability of Giant Exomoons of Wide Separation Giant Planets","abstract":"The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will conduct a Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to discover bound and free-floating exoplanets using gravitational microlensing. Roman should be sensitive to lenses with mass down to ~ 0.02 $M_{\\oplus}$, or roughly the mass of Ganymede. Thus the detection of moons with masses similar to the giant moons in our Solar System is possible with Roman. Measuring the demographics of exomoons will provide constraints on both moon and planet formation. We conduct simulations of Roman microlensing events to determine the effects of exomoons on microlensing light curves, and whether these effects are detectable with Roman. We focus on giant planets from 30 $M_{\\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that each planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman is sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of order one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or massive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in particular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the detection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect exomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens microlensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman.","published":"2025-09-03T17:23:06Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.IM"]}

Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \\sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.","published":"2025-10-13T05:57:43Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","hep-ph"]}

We find that, in certain cosmological scenarios, PTs can be delayed and prolonged compared to the standard post-inflationary evolution. Incorporating these PT parameters, we compute the resulting GW spectrum generated from the various processes occurring during a first-order PT: bubble collisions, sound waves, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that, in comparison to the standard cosmological history, the GW amplitude and peak frequency can be modified by several orders of magnitude due to the additional enhancement or suppression arising from the cosmological evolution during reheating.

We then use our approach to measure the shear 4PCF and the fourth-order aperture mass statistics in the DES Y3 survey. We construct an efficient estimator for fourth-order shear statistics which builds on the multipole decomposition of the shear 4PCF. We then validate our estimator on mock ellipticity catalogues obtained from Gaussian random fields and on realistic $N$-body simulations. Finally, we apply our estimator to the DES Y3 data and present a measurement of the fourth-order aperture statistics in a non-tomographic setup.

The availability of modern clustering algorithms, together with \\textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and complementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of Galactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in the spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to more distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695 candidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the physical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we then clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area, four of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different age groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic observations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790 ($110\\pm15\\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a few tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse population of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm.

Exploiting the existing task-based parallelism in SWIFT, novel combinations of algorithms are presented which enable SWIFT to function as a truly heterogeneous software leveraging CPUs for memory-bound computations concurrently with GPUs for compute-bound computations in a manner which minimises the effects of CPU-GPU communication latency. These algorithms are validated in extensive testing which shows that the GPU acceleration methodology is capable of delivering up to 3.5x speedups for SWIFTs SPH hydrodynamics computation kernels when including the time required to prepare the computations on the CPU and unpack the results on the CPU. Speedups of 7.5x are demonstrated when not including the CPU data preparation and unpacking times. Whilst these measured speedups are substantial, it is shown that the overall performance of the hydrodynamic solver for a full simulation when accelerated on the GPU of state-of-the-art superchips, is only marginally faster than the code performance when using the Grace Hopper superchips fully parallelised CPU capabilities. This is shown to be mostly due to excessive fine-graining of the tasks prior to offloading on the GPU. Fine-graining introduces significant over-heads associated with task management on the CPU hosting the simulation and also introduces un-necessary duplication of CPU-GPU communications of the same data.","published":"2025-05-20T15:55:54Z","categories":["cs.PF","astro-ph.IM","68U01"]}

We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i<3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i>3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\\tau_d < 10P_\\mathrm{SMBH}$.

Like any accretion flow this disk is turbulent, and therefore the emission from its surface will vary stochastically. As the disk has a finite mass supply (i.e., at most the initial mass of the disrupted star) the disk will also undergo long-timescale evolution, as this material is lost into the black hole. In this paper we combine theoretical models for this long time evolution of the disk with models for the stochastic variability of turbulent accretion flows which are correlated on short (orbital) timescales. This new framework allows us to demonstrate that (i) dimming events should be more prevalent than brightening events in long term TDE X-ray light curves (i.e., their log-luminosity distribution should be asymmetric), (ii) TDE X-ray light curves should follow a near- (but formally sub-)linear correlation between their root mean square variability and the mean flux, (iii) the fractional variability observed on short timescales across an X-ray observing band should increase with observing energy, and (iv) TDEs offer a unique probe of the physics of disk turbulence, owing to their clean spectra and natural evolutionary timescales. We confirm predictions (i) and (ii) with an analysis of the long timescale variability of two observed TDEs, and show strong support for prediction (iii) using the intra-observation variability of the same two sources.","published":"2025-05-14T09:26:50Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

However, nearby mCVs have a much lower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse X-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray emission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV band using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72 sources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of spectral index $\\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at $\\Gamma=0.5\\pm0.4$ and $1.8\\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The soft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray sources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously known CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index $\\Gamma<1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of spin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution of the $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and candidate CVs has a mean value of <$\\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=415\\pm39$ eV. Furthermore, we computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band for different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard sources that the $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux.

(2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V''-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs.

These sources were classified as active galactic nuclei, mainly blazars, based on optical spectroscopy. The main goals of this work are to examine these associations, classify the blazars based on their multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and identify potential masquerading BL Lac objects. Through SED analysis, we assess whether the multi-wavelength emission follows the characteristic double-peaked curve of blazars. Additionally, we propose the region of origin of the emission at different wavelengths, investigate the correlation between $\\gamma$-ray and lower-energy emission, and classify objects as low-, intermediate-, high- or extreme high synchrotron peaked (LSP, ISP, HSP, E-HSP) blazars. We search for masquerading BL Lacs, a class of flat-spectrum radio quasars where broad emission lines are swamped by non-thermal jet emission. The multi-wavelength analysis revealed that the 64 radio-loud sources in our sample exhibit an SED with a double-peak structure, typically ascribed to jet activity. Based on the synchrotron peak, 46 are HSP, 11 as ISP, and 7 as LSP. We also found 9--18 masquerading BL Lac candidates ($\\approx$15--30\\% of the radio-loud sample). For the 13 radio-quiet UGSs, the SEDs do not exhibit the double-peak structure typical of jetted AGN.

{"id":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2506.04199v2","title":"Abundance Effects from Protoplanetary Disk Outflows","abstract":"Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.","published":"2025-06-04T17:44:14Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.SR"]}

Most proposed ringlet confinement mechanisms presume that there are one or more shepherd satellites whose gravitational perturbations keeps the ringlet confined radially, but the absence of such shepherds in Cassini observations of Saturn's rings casts doubt upon those ringlet confinement mechanisms. The following uses a suite of N-body simulations to explore an alternate scenario, whereby ringlet self-gravity drives a narrow eccentric ringlet into a self-confining state. These simulations show that, under a wide variety of initial conditions, an eccentric ringlet's secular perturbations of itself causes the eccentricity of its outer edge to grow at the expense of its inner edge. This causes the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter $q$ to grow over time until it exceeds the $q\\simeq\\sqrt{3}\/2$ threshold where the ringlet's orbit-averaged angular momentum flux due to viscosity + self-gravity is zero. The absence of any net radial angular momentum transfer through the ringlet means that the ringlet has settled into a self-confining state, i.e. it does not spread radially due to its viscosity, and simulations also show that such ringlets have sharp edges. Nonetheless, viscosity still circularizes the ringlet in time $\\tau_e\\sim10^6$ orbits $\\sim1000$ years, which will cause the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter to shrink below the $q\\simeq\\sqrt{3}\/2$ threshold and allows radial spreading to resume. Either sharp-edged narrow eccentric ringlets are transient phenomena, or exterior perturbations are also sustaining the ringlet's eccentricity. We then speculate about how such ringlets might come to be.","published":"2025-05-10T13:10:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

They can be observed indirectly through redshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it is Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but the cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the streaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a nuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the constraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have to be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We demonstrate that by splitting the halo\/galaxy samples according to their density environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the total signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global measurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement arises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian distributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its local density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean streaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the data, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively turning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal. Our findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD observations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space distortions.","published":"2025-05-01T15:37:28Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

We study the individual and cumulative impact of stellar feedback processes on massive black hole (MBH) growth in a simulated low-mass dwarf galaxy. Methods. A suite of high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations called Noctua is performed, using the ArepoNoctua numerical framework for BHs in galaxy simulations. The chemical evolution of the gas is explicitly modelled in a time-dependent non-equilibrium way. Two types of stellar feedback are considered: individually-traced type II supernova (SNII) explosions, and radiatively transferred (on-the-fly) ionising stellar radiation (ISR) from OB stars. As part of the numerical framework, we develop and apply a novel physically-motivated model for MBH gas accretion, taking into account the angular momentum of the gas in the radiatively efficient regime, to estimate the gas accretion rate from the sub-grid accretion disc. Results. Without any stellar feedback, an initial $10^4~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ MBH is able to steadily grow over time, roughly doubling its mass after 800 Myr. Surprisingly, the growth of the MBH is more than doubled when only ISR feedback is considered, compared to the no stellar feedback run. This is due to the star formation rate (SFR) being highly suppressed (to a similar level or slightly above that when SNII feedback is considered), enabling a higher cumulative net gas inflow onto the MBH from not only the cold neutral- and molecular medium phases, but also the unstable- and warm neutral medium phases. With SNII feedback included, the gas accretion onto the MBH is episodic over time, and is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude already during the first 150 Myr. When combining SNII with ISR feedback, the growth of the MBH remains suppressed due to SNII feedback, but to a lesser extent compared to the SNII-only feedback run, due to a slightly lower SFR, and hence a reduced number of SNII events.","published":"2025-04-10T18:00:02Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

A thin   parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the   magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this   reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic   electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the   accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework   to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of   the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative   investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be   directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The   theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of   our model.","published":"2025-02-01T17:52:05Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.","published":"2025-10-08T18:00:00Z","categories":["astro-ph.EP"]}

It is usually believed that the spin-down energy injected from the pulsars is converted into magnetic field and relativistic electrons, but the possible presence of proton acceleration inside PWNe cannot be ruled out. Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission from PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such results rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the contribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino emission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the ones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model the temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of protons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for young PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion fraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic process, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the neutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the measured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV. At higher energy around 1 PeV, the neutrino emission from the population highly depends on the injection spectral shape, and also on the emission of the nearby prominent sources.","published":"2025-01-15T17:08:58Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE"]}

In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information.

Additional high-resolution spectroscopic data were obtained with MUSE at the VLT. Our research is based on strong lensing analyses that rely on these measurements.

We fit these mass profiles with one-component, spherically symmetric mass models including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), non-singular isothermal sphere, beta model, and Hernquist profiles. We perform a Bayesian analysis to sample the posterior probability distributions of the free parameters of the models. We find that the NFW, Hernquist, and beta models are the most suitable profiles to fit the measured projected cluster total mass profiles. Moreover, we test the robustness of our results in a twofold way: we slightly modify the center of the projected mass profiles and the radial range of the considered region.

Continuum & polarization behavior from MHD simulations","abstract":"The persistence of radiative signatures in giant radio galaxies remains a frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr. High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs. The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing turbulence in the cocoon.","published":"2025-10-03T14:18:52Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\\nu_{\\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\\rm rms} \\approx 10^{-35} (\\nu_{\\rm s}\/ 10 {\\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*\/10 {\\rm km})^2 (\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}\/1 {\\rm yr})^{1\/2} (f_{\\rm acc}\/1 {\\rm kHz})^{-1\/2} (\\dot{M}\/10^{-8} \\text{M}_{\\odot} \\text{yr}^{-1}) (v\/0.4c) (d\/1 {\\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.","published":"2025-01-09T04:44:24Z","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.SR","gr-qc"]}
{"id":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2506.00758v1","title":"Sampling Bayesian probabilities given only sampled priors","abstract":"A typical Bayesian inference on the values of some parameters of interest $q$ from some data $D$ involves running a Markov Chain (MC) to sample from the posterior $p(q,n | D) \\propto \\mathcal{L}(D | q,n) p(q) p(n),$ where $n$ are some nuisance parameters. In many cases, the nuisance parameters are high-dimensional, and their prior $p(n)$ is itself defined only by a set of samples that have been drawn from some other MC. Two problems arise: first, the MC for the posterior will typically require evaluation of $p(n)$ at arbitrary values of $n,$ \\ie\\ one needs to provide a density estimator over the full $n$ space from the provided samples. Second, the high dimensionality of $n$ hinders both the density estimation and the efficiency of the MC for the posterior. We describe a solution to this problem: a linear compression of the $n$ space into a much lower-dimensional space $u$ which projects away directions in $n$ space that cannot appreciably alter $\\mathcal{L}.$ The algorithm for doing so is a slight modification to principal components analysis, and is less restrictive on $p(n)$ than other proposed solutions to this issue. We demonstrate this ``mode projection'' technique using the analysis of 2-point correlation functions of weak lensing fields and galaxy density in the \\textit{Dark Energy Survey}, where $n$ is a binned representation of the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the galaxies.","published":"2025-06-01T00:09:30Z","categories":["astro-ph.IM","astro-ph.CO"]}

First image and source catalogue","abstract":"Radio-interferometric arrays require very precise calibration to detect the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. A remarkably complete and accurate sky model is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the calibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration strategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions. We have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to make a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H (J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\\,\\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth data centred at $147.4\\,\\rm{MHz}$. Using multiple GMRT pointings, we have made a $6.9^\\circ\\times6.9^\\circ$ mosaic, which yields a median rms of $3.9^{+3.7}_{-1.4}\\,{\\rm mJy\/beam}$ that reduces to $\\sim2\\,{\\rm mJy\/beam}$ at source-free regions. In the overlapping patch, this rms is deeper than the GLEAM catalogue, which is used for HERA calibration. We produce a catalogue of $640$ sources ($26\\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\\,{\\rm Jy}$. The catalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are consistent with existing catalogues. The differential source counts are found to be deeper than GLEAM and consistent with LoTSS. Preliminary simulations of the sky models from GLEAM and our catalogue show $\\sim 10-25\\%$ difference in the visibility amplitude, with relatively small phase difference ($\\approx 2^\\circ$). Future work is planned for larger survey areas and wider bandwidth to reduce the rms and measure the in-band source spectral indices, which are expected to enhance the fidelity of the HERA calibration model.","published":"2025-10-10T17:23:56Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.IM"]}

This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2\/dof<2) for {these 12 targets} assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.","published":"2025-04-01T18:21:20Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA"]}

We derive models that can bring residual biases to the percent level on small scales. We elucidate the impact of aliasing and the varying shape of HEALPix pixels on power spectra and show how the HEALPix pixel window function approximation is made in the discrete spin-2 setting. We propose several improvements to the standard estimator and its modelling, based on the principle that source positions and weights are to be considered fixed. We show how empty pixels can be accounted for either by modifying the mixing matrices or applying correction factors that we derive. We introduce an approximate interlacing scheme for the HEALPix grid and show that it can mitigate the effects of aliasing. We introduce bespoke pixel window functions adapted to the survey footprint and show that, for band-limited spectra, biases from using an isotropic window function can be effectively reduced to zero. This work partly intends to serve as a useful reference for pixel-related effects in angular power spectra, which are of relevance for ongoing and forthcoming lensing and clustering surveys.","published":"2025-01-15T10:58:59Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO"]}

Along with MgXII K$\\alpha$, we detect SiXIV K$\\alpha$ absorption, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot 'super-virial' gas in the CGM. Both from the model-independent calculations and hybrid-ionization modeling, we infer four phases at distinct temperatures, hot 'super-virial' ($5.4^{+1.9}_{-0.8} \\times 10^7$ K), warm-hot 'virial' ($1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \\times 10^6$ K), warm 'sub-virial' ($2.2\\pm 0.5 \\times 10^5$ K), and cool phase ($<1.7 \\times 10^5$ K). The warm-hot and hot phases are $\\alpha$-enhanced, and [C\/O] and [Ne\/O] are super-solar in the warm-hot phase, while [Mg\/O] and [Si\/O] are super-solar in the hot phase. The low-ionization lines are blue-shifted (v$_{\\rm los} \\approx -100$ km s$^{-1}$), whereas the high-ionization lines are red-shifted. It suggests a scenario of infalling sub-virial, quasi-static virial, and outflowing super-virial phases along this sightline. Earlier studies on individual sightlines were confined to the Northern Hemisphere. Our sightline is located in the Southern hemisphere, demonstrating that hot super-virial gas is also present at Southern Galactic latitudes as well. This confirms a more widespread distribution of the super-virial gas across both hemispheres.","published":"2025-09-02T07:06:03Z","categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.HE"]}

This paper introduces the Subhalo-based Halo Alignment and Projected Ellipticity (SHAPE) technique, which reconstructs cluster halo shapes from the projected distribution of subhaloes, providing a novel approach to investigate intrinsic alignment (IA) correlations between cluster halo shapes and the surrounding density field. We measure halo shapes and orientations using different line-of-sight projection depths and find that, with modest projection depths, the shapes and orientations recovered by SHAPE show good agreement with those measured directly from the simulation particles. Using these SHAPE-derived shapes, we compute IA correlation functions from N-body simulations in both real and redshift space. The IA correlation multipoles exhibit features consistent with baryon acoustic oscillations around 100 Mpc\/h and show redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects that agree well with predictions from a non-linear alignment model incorporating RSD. We further demonstrate that the structure growth rate parameter can be robustly estimated without bias from these IA correlations, providing a new avenue for cosmological parameter estimation. Expanding the IA correlations in an associated Legendre basis yields results consistent with those from the standard Legendre expansion, but with improved statistical significance. These results suggest that SHAPE may enhance cosmological parameter constraints in future galaxy surveys.","published":"2025-05-02T21:13:21Z","categories":["astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA"]}
