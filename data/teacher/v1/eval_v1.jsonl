We show that the dominant effect of cold dark matter on gravitational waves from astrophysical sources is a small frequency dependent modification of the propagation speed of gravitational waves. However, the magnitude of the effect is too small to be detected in the near future. We furthermore show that the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves in principle contains detailed information about the properties of dark matter. However, depending on the wavelength, the effects are either suppressed because the dark matter is highly non-relativistic or because it contributes a small fraction of the energy density of the universe. As a consequence, the effects of cold dark matter on primordial gravitational waves in practice also appear too small to be detectable."}

We study this behavior theoretically and find that it can be well explained by the standard forward shock model involving a thin shell expanding in either a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) or a wind environment. We also found that short GRBs and supernova-associated GRBs, which are at relatively smaller distances, marginally match the flux-redshift relationship and they could be outliers. We rule out the assumption that the medium density evolves with redshift as from the current measurements of and for short and long GRBs. In addition, the possible dependence of host flux on the redshift is also investigated. We find that a similar redshift independence of the flux exists for host galaxies as well, which implies that the detection rate of radio hosts might also be independent of the redshift. It is also hinted that most radio hosts have the spectral indices ranging from to 2.5 in statistics. Finally, we predict the detection rates of radio afterglows by the next-generation radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)."}

During the build up of the dense gas around the hot bubble, mixing of hot bubble gas with other regions of the intracluster medium (ICM) heats the ICM. The vortices that mix the ICM with the hot bubble gas also excite shock waves, sound waves, and turbulence. Sound waves, shocks, turbulence, and uplifted gas, might be easier to detect than the mixing process and hence attract more attention, but we argue that the contributions of these processes to the heating of the ICM do not add up to the level of contribution of the mixing-heating process."}

Here, we report the first space-based optical transmission spectrum of the planet using two HST/STIS transit observations from 0.53-1.03 microns. We find no evidence for alkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53 microns. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (~100-1000x solar) while moderate metallicity scenarios (~100x solar) require aerosol opacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze models. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 microns in the transmission spectra of 3 different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b, and GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other instruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect. Only the transit spectrum of GJ 1214b is well fit by a model with stellar plages on the photosphere of the host star. Our photometric monitoring of the host star reveals a stellar rotation rate of 44.1 days and an activity cycle of 7.4 years. Intriguingly, GJ 436 does not become redder as it gets dimmer, which is expected if star spots were dominating the variability. These insights into the nature of the GJ 436 system help refine our expectations for future observations in the era of JWST, whose higher precision and broader wavelength coverage will shed light on the composition and structure of GJ 436b's atmosphere."}

All three active regions produced series flares and CMEs. We followed the evolution of the components of the WG_M and the magnetic helicity before the flare and CME occurrences. We found an unique and mutually shared behavior, called the U-shaped pattern, of the weighted distance component of WG_M and of the shearing component of the helicity flux before the flare and CME eruptions. This common pattern is associated with the decreasing-receding phase yet reported only known to be a necessary feature prior to solar flare eruption(s), but found now at the same time in the evolution of the shearing helicity parameter. This result leads to the conclusion that (i) the shearing motion of photospheric magnetic field may be a key driver for the solar eruption in addition to the flux emerging process, and that (ii) the found decreasing-approaching pattern in the evolution of shearing helicity may be another precursor indicator for improving the forecasting of solar eruptions."}

The 3D magnetic structure is based on potential field extrapolation encompassing a vertical range from the photosphere through the chromosphere and transition region into the low corona. The basis of our proxy measure of activity prediction is the so-called weighted horizontal gradient of magnetic field (WG_M) defined between spots of opposite polarities close to the polarity inversion line of an active region. The temporal variation of the distance of the barycenter of the opposite polarities is also found to possess potentially important diagnostic information about the flare onset time estimation as function of height similar to its counterpart introduced initially in an application at the photosphere only in Korsos et al. (2015). We apply the photospheric pre-flare behavioural patterns of sunspot groups to the evolution of their associated 3D-constructed AR 11429 as function of height. We found that at a certain height in the lower solar atmosphere the onset time may be estimated much earlier than at the photosphere or at any other heights. Therefore, we present a tool and recipe that may potentially identify the optimum height for flare prognostic in the solar atmosphere allowing to improve our flare prediction capability and capacity."}

The need for foreground removal has led to the development of two main techniques, often referred to as \"foreground avoidance\" and \"foreground subtraction.\" Avoidance is associated with filtering foregrounds in Fourier space, while subtraction uses an explicit foreground model that is removed. Using 1088 hours of data from the 64-element PAPER array, we demonstrate that subtraction of a foreground model prior to delay-space foreground filtering results in a modest but measurable improvement of the performance of the filter. This proof-of-concept result shows that improvement stems from the reduced dynamic range requirements needed for the foreground filter: subtraction of a foreground model reduces the total foreground power, so for a fixed dynamic range, the filter can push towards fainter limits. We also find that the choice of window function used in the foreground filter can have an appreciable affect on the performance near the edges of the observing band. We demonstrate these effects using a smaller 3 hour sampling of data from the MWA, and find that the hybrid filtering and subtraction removal approach provides similar improvements across the band as seen in the case with PAPER-64."}

AR 12192 was the largest region of Solar Cycle 24; it underwent noticeable growth and produced 6 X-class flares, 22 M-class flares, and 53 C-class flares in the course of its disc passage. However, the most peculiar fact of this AR is that it was associated with only one CME in spite of producing several X-class flares. In this work, we carry out a comparative study between the eruptive and non-eruptive flares produced by AR 12192. We find that the magnitude of abrupt and permanent changes in the horizontal magnetic field and Lorentz force are significantly smaller in the case of the confined flares compared to the eruptive one. We present the areal evolution of AR 12192 during its disc passage. We find the flare-related morphological changes to be weaker during the confined flares, whereas the eruptive flare exhibits a rapid and permanent disappearance of penumbral area away from the magnetic neutral line after the flare. Furthermore, from the extrapolated nonlinear force-free magnetic field, we examine the overlying coronal magnetic environment over the eruptive and non-eruptive zones of the AR. We find that the critical decay index for the onset of torus instability was achieved at a lower height over the eruptive flaring region, than for the non-eruptive core area. These results suggest that the decay rate of the gradient of overlying magnetic field strength may play a decisive role to determine the CME productivity of the AR. In addition, the magnitude of changes in the flare-related magnetic characteristics are found to be well correlated with the nature of solar eruptions."}

Our analysis is based on medium (R 14000) and high (R 40000) resolution spectroscopic data of the stars. The abundance of 18 elements are derived: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, and Ba. The masses of HD 23193 and HD 170920 are estimated from evolutionary tracks, as and . The ages are found Myr for HD 23193 and Myr for HD 170920 using isochrones. The abundance pattern of HD 23193 shows deviations from solar values in the iron-peak elements and indicates remarkable overabundances of Sr (1.16), Y (1.03), and Ba (1.24) with respect to the solar abundances. We compare the derived abundances of this moderately rotating ( sin km s ) Am star to the theoretical chemical evolution models including rotational mixing. The theoretically predicted abundances resemble our derived abundance pattern, except for a few elements (Si and Cr). For HD 170920, we find nearly solar abundances, except for C ( ), S (0.16), Ti (0.15), Ni (0.16), Zn (0.41), Y (0.57), and Ba (0.97).

We show that the large-scale nonuniform flow is produced due to ether a combined action of a density stratified rotating turbulence and uniform kinetic helicity or a combined effect of a rotating incompressible turbulence and inhomogeneous kinetic helicity. These effects result in the formation of a large-scale shear, and in turn its interaction with the small-scale turbulence causes an excitation of the large-scale instability (known as a vorticity dynamo) due to a combined effect of the large-scale shear and Reynolds stress-induced generation of the mean vorticity. The latter is due to the effect of large-scale shear on the Reynolds stress. A fast rotation suppresses this large-scale instability."}

Their evolutionary history is an enigma: their surface gravity is too high for main sequence stars, but too low for single evolution white dwarfs. They are most likely byproducts of binary evolution, including blue-stragglers, extremely-low mass white dwarf stars (ELMs) and their precursors (pre-ELMs). A small number of ELMs with similar properties to sdAs is known. Other possibilities include metal-poor A/F dwarfs, second generation stars, or even stars accreted from dwarf galaxies. In this work, we analyse colours, proper motions and spacial velocities of a sample of sdAs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to assess their nature and evolutionary origin. We define a probability of belonging to the main sequence and a probability of being a (pre-)ELM based on these properties. We find that 7 per cent of the sdAs are more likely to be (pre-)ELMs than main sequence stars. However, the spacial velocity distribution suggests that over 35 per cent of them cannot be explained as single metal-poor A/F stars."}

Here we report a practical way to find out if a neutron star in a transient LMXB has reached the spin equilibrium by disk--magnetosphere interaction alone, and if not, to estimate this spin equilibrium frequency. These can be done using specific measurable source luminosities, such as the luminosity corresponding to the transition between the accretion and propeller phases, and the known stellar spin rate. Such a finding can be useful to test if the spin distribution of millisecond pulsars, as well as an observed upper cutoff of their spin rates, can be explained using disk--magnetosphere interaction alone, or additional spin-down mechanisms, such as gravitational radiation, are required. Applying our method, we find that the neutron star in the transient LMXB Aql X--1 has not yet reached the spin equilibrium by disk--magnetosphere interaction alone. We also perform numerical computations, with and without gravitational radiation, to study the spin evolution of Aql X--1 through a series of outbursts and to constrain its properties. While we find that the gravitational wave emission from Aql X--1 cannot be established with certainty, our numerical results show that the gravitational radiation from Aql X--1 is possible, with a g cm upper limit of the neutron star misaligned mass quadrupole moment."}

Six out of the 42 protocluster candidates include 1-12 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at redshifts up to z=6.574. By the comparisons with the cosmological Lya radiative transfer (RT) model reproducing LAEs with the reionization effects, we find that more than a half of these protocluster candidates are progenitors of the present-day clusters with a mass of > 10^14 M_sun. We then investigate the correlation between LAE overdensity delta and Lya rest-frame equivalent width EW_Lya^rest, because the cosmological Lya RT model suggests that a slope of EW_Lya^rest-delta relation is steepened towards the epoch of cosmic reionization (EoR), due to the existence of the ionized bubbles around galaxy overdensities easing the escape of Lya emission from the partly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). The available HSC data suggest that the slope of the EW_Lya^rest-delta correlation does not evolve from the post-reionization epoch z=5.7 to the EoR z=6.6 beyond the moderately large statistical errors. There is a possibility that we would detect the evolution of the EW_Lya^rest - delta relation from z=5.7 to 7.3 by the upcoming HSC observations providing large samples of LAEs at z=6.6-7.3."}

We verify these estimates by comparing our new results to previous analyses of nearby stars, examining fiducial cluster properties, and estimating the power-law slope of the local present-day mass function. A comparison to previous studies suggests that our mass estimates are robust, while metallicity and age estimates are increasingly uncertain.

One plausible solution to this could be the small-scale dynamo which cannot be fully resolved by global simulations. The small-scale Lorentz force suppresses the convective motions and also the turbulent mixing of entropy between upflows and downflows, leading to a large effective Prandtl number ( ). We explore this idea in three-dimensional global rotating convection simulations at different thermal conductivity ( ), i.e., at different . In agreement with previous non-rotating simulations, the convective velocity is reduced with the increase of as long as the thermal conductive flux is negligible. A subadiabatic layer is formed near the base of the convection zone due to continuous deposition of low entropy plumes in low- simulations. The most interesting result of our low- simulations is that the convective motions are accompanied by a change in the convection structure that is increasingly influenced by small-scale plumes. These plumes tend to transport angular momentum radially inward and thus establish an anti-solar differential rotation, in striking contrast to the solar rotation profile. If such low diffusive plumes, driven by the radiative-surface cooling, are present in the Sun, then our results cast doubt on the idea that a high effective may be a viable solution to the solar convective conundrum. Our study also emphasizes that any resolution of the conundrum that relies on the downward plumes must take into account angular momentum transport as well as heat transport."}

In particular, it has been suggested that dark matter could form Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) or degenerate Fermi cores. We examine these possibilities under the assumption that the core consists of highly condensed DM (either bosons or fermions) that is embedded in a diffuse envelope (e.g., isothermal sphere). The novelty of our approach is that we invoke composite polytropes to model spherical collisionless structures in a way that is physically intuitive and can be generalized to include other equations of state (EOSs). Our model is very amenable to the analysis of BEC cores (composed of ultra-light bosons) that have been proposed to resolve small-scale CDM anomalies. We show that the analysis can readily be applied to bosons with or without small repulsive self-interactions. With respect to degenerate Fermi cores, we confirm that fermionic particle masses between 1 -- 1000 keV are not excluded by the observations. Finally, we note that this approach can be extended to include a wide range of EOSs in addition to multi-component collisionless systems."}

SEAMBHs have been demonstrated to be able to provide a new tool for estimating cosmological distance. Thus, we create a series of mock data sets of SEAMBHs, especially in the high redshift region, to check their abilities to probe the cosmology. To fulfill the potential of the SEAMBHs on the cosmology, we apply the simulated data to three projects. The first is the exploration of their abilities to constrain the cosmological parameters, in which we combine different data sets of current observations such as the cosmic microwave background from { Planck} and type Ia supernovae from Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA). We find that the high redshift SEAMBHs can help to break the degeneracies of the background cosmological parameters constrained by { Planck} and JLA, thus giving much tighter constraints of the cosmological parameters. The second uses the high redshift SEAMBHs as the complements of the low redshift JLA to constrain the early expansion rate and the dark energy density evolution in the cold dark matter frame. Our results show that these high redshift SEAMBHs are very powerful on constraining the early Hubble rate and the evolution of the dark energy density; thus they can give us more information about the expansion history of our Universe, which is also crucial for testing the CDM model in the high redshift region. Finally, we check the SEAMBH candles' abilities to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy at high redshift. In summary, our results show that the SEAMBHs, as the rare candles in the high redshift region, can provide us a new and independent observation to probe cosmology in the future."}

It means that the distributions do not depend on the primary particle energy or mass (thus, neither on the interaction model), shower zenith angle or shower to shower fluctuations, if they are taken at the same shower age. Together with previous work showing the universality of the distributions of the electron energy, of the lateral distance (integrated over angles) and of the angle (integrated over lateral distance) for fixed electron energy this paper completes a full universal description of the electron states at various shower ages. Analytical parametrizations of the full electron states are given. It is also shown that some distributions can be described by a smaller than five numbers of variables, the new ones being products of the old ones raised to some powers. The accuracy of the present parametrization is sufficiently good for applying to showers with the primary energy uncertainty of 14% (as it is at the Pierre Auger Observatory). The shower fluctuations in the chosen bins of the multidimensional variable space are about 6%, determining the minimum uncertainty needed for parametrization of the universal distributions. An analytical way of estimation of the effect of the geomagnetic field is given. Thanks to the universality of the electron distributions in any shower a new method of shower reconstruction can be worked out from data of the observatories using the fluorescence technique. The light fluxes (both fluorescence and Cherenkov) for any shower age can be exactly predicted for a shower with any primary energy and shower maximum depth, so that the two quantities can be obtained by best fitting the predictions to the measurements"}

These cosmic magnetic fields can be generated at very high temperature, much above electroweak scale, due to the gravitational anomaly in presence of the chiral asymmetry. The chiral asymmetry leads to instability in the plasma which ultimately leads to the generation of magnetic fields. In this article, we discuss the generation of gravitational waves, during the period of instability, in the chiral plasma sourced by the magnetic field created due to the gravitational anomaly. We have shown that such gravitational wave will have a unique spectrum. Moreover, depending on the temperature of the universe at the time of its generation, such gravitational waves can have a wide range of frequencies. We also estimate the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves and delineate the possibility of its detection by future experiments like eLISA."}

Modern colour-coded diagrams are used for distinguishing between bounded and escaping motion. In addition, the smaller alignment index (SALI) method is deployed for determining the regular, sticky or chaotic nature of bounded orbits. We reveal the basins of escape corresponding to the escape through the two symmetrical escape channels around the Lagrange points and and also we relate them with the corresponding distribution of the escape times of the orbits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the stable manifolds, around the index-1 saddle points, accurately define the fractal basin boundaries observed in the colour-coded diagrams. The development scenario of the fundamental vertical Lyapunov periodic orbit is thoroughly explored for obtaining a more complete view of the unfolding of the singular behaviour of the dynamics at the cusp values of the parameters. Finally, we examine how the combination of the most important parameters of the bar (such as the semi-major axis and the angular velocity) influences the observed stellar structures (rings and spirals) which are formed by escaping stars guided by the invariant manifolds near the saddle points."}

Despite this common source, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different, with acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing towards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared observations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane. We confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are decoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years. The acetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at 30 N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 0.8 parts per million (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at with a VMR of 0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we move from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric about the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and its latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric mixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena. Unlike acetylene, ethane has a symmetric distribution about the equator that increases toward the pole, with a peak mole fraction of 18 ppm at about latitude, with a minimum at the equator of 10 ppm at 1 mbar. [...] The equator-to-pole distributions of acetylene and ethane are consistent with acetylene having a shorter lifetime than ethane that is not sensitive to longer advective timescales, but is augmented by short-term dynamics, such as vertical mixing.

The model can qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce the source dynamics and synchrotron light curves derived from numerical modelling. Approximate corrections for radiative and adiabatic losses allow it to predict the evolution of radio spectral index and of inverse-Compton emission both for active sources and for `remnant' sources after the jet has turned off. Code to implement the model is publicly available. Using a standard model with a light relativistic (electron-positron) jet, sub-equipartition magnetic fields, and a range of realistic group/cluster environments, I simulate populations of sources and show that the model can reproduce the range of properties of powerful radio sources as well as observed trends in the relationship between jet power and radio luminosity, and predicts their dependence on redshift and environment. I show that the distribution of source lifetimes has a significant effect on both the source length distribution and the fraction of remnant sources expected in observations, and so can in principle be constrained by observations. The remnant fraction is expected to be low even at low redshift and low observing frequency due to the rapid luminosity evolution of remnants, and to tend rapidly to zero at high redshift due to inverse-Compton losses."}

The determination of stellar parameters for the counterparts of X-ray sources is crucial for their study. This work extends the spectroscopic study of the RasTyc sample, based on TYCHO and RASS catalogs, to stars fainter than V=9.5 mag. We acquired 625 high-resolution spectra for 443 targets with four different instruments in the Northern hemisphere. The radial and rotational velocity (vsini) of our targets are measured by means of the cross-correlation technique, which is also helpful to discover binaries and multiple systems. We use the code ROTFIT for determining the atmospheric parameters and vsini of the single stars and SB1 systems. For these objects, we also measured the equivalent widths of the H and LiI-6708Å lines, which enables us to derive their chromospheric activity level and lithium abundance. We make use of Gaia DR1 parallaxes and proper motions for locating the targets in the HR diagram and for computing the space velocity components of the youngest objects. We find a remarkable fraction (>35%) of binaries and multiple systems. Our sample is mostly (60%) composed of stars younger than the members of the UMa cluster. We identify 42 very young stars, which lie above or very close to the Pleiades upper envelope of the lithium abundance.

PBHs much larger than this might have important consequences even if they provide only a small fraction of the dark matter. In particular, they could generate cosmological structure either individually through through the `seed' effect or collectively through the `Poisson' effect, thereby alleviating some problems associated with the standard CDM scenario. If the PBHs all have a similar mass and make a small contribution to the dark matter, then the seed effect dominates on small scales, in which case PBHs could seed the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or even galaxies themselves. If they have a similar mass and provide the dark matter, the Poisson effect dominates on all scales and the first bound clouds would form earlier than in the usual scenario, with interesting observational consequences. If the PBHs have an extended mass spectrum, which is more likely, they could fulfill all three roles - providing the dark matter, binding the first bound clouds and generating galaxies. In this case, the galactic mass function naturally has the observed form, with the galaxy mass being simply related to the black hole mass. The stochastic gravitational wave background from the PBHs in this scenario would extend continuously from the LIGO frequency to the LISA frequency, offering a potential goal for future surveys."}

However, this procedure is incapable of providing the confidence range on the estimated parameters. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm to perform a statistical fit of the observed broadband spectrum of blazars using different emission models. Moreover, in this work we use the the observable quantities as the fit parameters, rather than the direct source parameters which govern the resultant SED. This significantly improves the convergence time and eliminates the uncertainty regarding the initial guess parameters. This approach also has an added advantage of identifying the degenerate parameters, which can be removed by including more observable information and/or additional constraints. A computer code developed based on this algorithm is implemented as an user-defined routine in the standard X-ray spectral fitting package, XSPEC. Further, we demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm by fitting the well sampled SED of the blazar, 3C 279, during its gamma ray flare in 2014."}

Our regular photometric surveillance started in October 2015, and a sequence of dipping began in 2017 May continuing on through the end of 2017, when the star was no longer visible from Earth. We distinguish four main 1-2.5% dips, named \"Elsie,\" \"Celeste,\" \"Skara Brae,\" and \"Angkor\", which persist on timescales from several days to weeks. Our main results so far are: (i) there are no apparent changes of the stellar spectrum or polarization during the dips; (ii) the multiband photometry of the dips shows differential reddening favoring non-grey extinction. Therefore, our data are inconsistent with dip models that invoke optically thick material, but rather they are in-line with predictions for an occulter consisting primarily of ordinary dust, where much of the material must be optically thin with a size scale <<1um, and may also be consistent with models invoking variations intrinsic to the stellar photosphere.

Refraction thus creates a gray continuum in the planet's transmission spectrum which can hide spectral features associated with sources of atmospheric opacity. We combine refractive theory with recent analytical advances describing the effects of surfaces and clouds on transmission spectra, to express the location of this boundary in atmospheric opacity space, both for atomic and molecular extinction, as well as collision-induced absorption. This allows one to quickly estimate how refraction affects spectral features in well-mixed atmospheres. We show that differences in the geometry of limb observations between solar system planets and exoplanets leads to different locations of this boundary, and that more than four extra scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in exoplanet transits compared to solar system observations of cold gas giants. We explore how the location of this refractive boundary in exoplanet transits changes in a well-mixed isothermal atmosphere with its temperature and composition, the spectral type of the planet's host star, and the size of the planet. We demonstrate that five extra scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in a terrestrial planet with a CO atmosphere compared to a helium atmosphere, resulting in a flatter spectrum than from its smaller scale height alone. We provide results for a few exoplanets, notably those in the TRAPPIST-1 system, to help the scientific community estimate the impact of refraction on the size of spectral features without radiative transfer calculations, and thus help refine planned James Web Space Telescope observations."}

For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O but without H2, we model the multi-Gyr evolution of ocean temperature and chemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and atmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find that: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean chemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many waterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to previous claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical cycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C exchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by seafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass and ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our model, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early water-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of magnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory overlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for which the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as wide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for Sun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this effect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our findings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to our waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end calculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need for geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on waterworlds."}

Clusters (M_200>=10^14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure responsible for ~90% of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops for group-sized haloes (M_200~10^13 Msol) and is even lower (40-70%) for L* haloes between 0.1-0.3 R_200. Energy from feedback grows relative to the binding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from HSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes indicating that the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub- centrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer CGM of M_200<10^12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_200 and feeding uncorrelated tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation profiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky Way halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot haloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions also comprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations seen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback acts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying significant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We argue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the inner regions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for analytic models of the CGM."}

Here we use an extensive grid of 4500 time-dependent, multiwavelength radiation transport simulations to show that the sub- model can reproduce the entirety of the width-luminosity relation (WLR), while the model can only produce the brighter events , implying that fast-declining SNe Ia come from sub- explosions. We do not assume a particular theoretical paradigm for the progenitor or explosion mechanism, but instead construct parameterized models that vary the mass, kinetic energy, and compositional structure of the ejecta, thereby realizing a broad range of possible outcomes of white dwarf explosions. We provide fitting functions based on our large grid of detailed simulations that map observable properties of SNe Ia such as peak brightness and light curve width to physical parameters such as and total ejected mass. These can be used to estimate the physical properties of observed SNe Ia."}

Through a stacking analysis we directly measure the 850-μm flux density of LBGs in our deep (0.9mJy) James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) SCUBA-2 850-μm map, as well as deep public Herschel/SPIRE 250-, 350- and 500-μm imaging. We establish functional forms for the IRX-β relation to z ~ 5, confirming that there is no significant redshift evolution of the relation and that the resulting average IRX-β curve is consistent with a Calzetti-like attenuation law. We compare our results with recent work in the literature, finding that discrepancies in the slope of the IRX-β relation are driven by biases in the methodology used to determine the ultraviolet slopes. Consistent results are found when IRX-β is evaluated by stacking in bins of stellar mass, M, and we argue that the near-linear IRX-M relationship is a better proxy for correcting observed UV luminosities to total star formation rates, provided an accurate handle on M can be had, and also gives clues as to the physical driver of the role of dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift galaxies."}

The pairs have projected separations between 1 kpc and 30 kpc, and are selected to have radial velocity offsets less than 600 km/s and stellar mass ratio between 0.1 and 1. The pair fraction increases with both the physical size of the integral-field unit and the stellar mass, consistent with theoretical expectations. We provide the best-fit analytical function of the pair fraction and find that ~3% of M* galaxies are in close pairs. For both isolated galaxies and paired galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN) are selected using emission-line ratios and H_alpha equivalent widths measured inside apertures at a fixed physical size. We find AGNs in ~24% of the paired galaxies and binary AGNs in ~13% of the pairs. To account for the selection biases in both the pair sample and the MaNGA sample, we compare the AGN comoving volume densities with those expected from the mass- and redshift-dependent AGN fractions. We find a strong (~5x) excess of binary AGNs over random pairing and a mild (~20%) deficit of single AGNs. The binary AGN excess increases from ~2x to ~6x as the projected separation decreases from 10-30 kpc to 1-10 kpc. Our results indicate that pairing of galaxies preserves the AGN duty cycle in individual galaxies but increases the population of binary AGNs through correlated activities. We suggest tidally-induced galactic-scale shocks and AGN cross-ionization as two plausible channels to produce low-luminosity narrow-line-selected binary AGNs."}

A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in individual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A+B model for the specific supernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges for large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of validity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates. Moreover, the A+B model it is not directly derived from a delay time distribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a simple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component. The model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational constraints. It yields a prompt fraction of in agreement with results based on volumetric rates of type Ia supernovae at high redshift (Rodney et al. 2014). The model is tested against realistic star formation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be self consistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the features of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data. In terms of goodness of fit, the new model is strongly preferred over the A+B model. At there are no constraints from observations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay time distribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times."}

Using this definition, similar to the well-known concept of \"influence radius\", we found a \"fundamental plane\" connecting the BHS typical density with the GC central surface density profile, total luminosity and observational half-mass radius. Our approach allows us to define a unique way to connect the observational GCs parameters with their dark content. Comparing our results with observed Milky Way GCs, we found that many of them likely host, at the present time, as many as several hundreds of BHs. These BHS are characterized by a relatively low typical density, pc and composed of relatively massive BHs, with average masses in the range . We also show that a similar approach can be used to find Milky Way GCs potentially hosting an intermediate-mass black hole."}

Its location, in the core of the massive globular cluster 47 Tuc, hints at a dynamical origin. We assess the stability of mass transfer from a carbon-oxygen white dwarf onto compact objects of various masses, and conclude that for mass transfer to proceed stably the accretor must, in fact, be a black hole. Such systems can form dynamically by the collision of a stellar-mass black hole with a giant star. Tidal dissipation of energy in the giant's envelope leads to a bound binary with a pericentre separation less than the radius of the giant. An episode of common-envelope evolution follows, which ejects the giant's envelope. We find that the most likely target is a horizontal-branch star, and that a realistic quantity of subsequent dynamical hardening is required for the resulting binary to merge via gravitational wave emission. Observing one binary like 47 Tuc X9 in the Milky Way globular cluster system is consistent with the expected formation rate. The observed 6.8-day periodicity in the X-ray emission may be driven by eccentricity induced in the UCXB's orbit by a perturbing companion."}

Cosmologically-motivated theories of galaxy formation need feedback from these super-massive black holes to regulate star formation. In the absence of such feedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations dramatically fail to reproduce the number density and properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe. However, there is no observational evidence of this strongly coupled co-evolution between super-massive black holes and star formation, impeding our understanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we show that the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their integrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central super-massive black hole. Our results suggest that black hole mass growth scales with gas cooling rate in the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation takes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies hosting more massive central black holes. The observed relation between black hole mass and star formation efficiency applies to all generations of stars formed throughout a galaxy's life, revealing a continuous interplay between black hole activity and baryon cooling."}

As there are many different observational probes of the PBH density across different masses, constraints on PBH models are dependent on the functional form of the PBH mass function. This complicates general statements about the mass functions allowed by current data, and, in particular, about the maximum total density of PBH. Numerical studies suggest that some forms of extended mass functions face tighter constraints than monochromatic mass functions, but they do not preclude the existence of a functional form for which constraints are relaxed. We use analytical arguments to show that the mass function which maximizes the fraction of the matter density in PBH subject to all constraints is a finite linear combination of monochromatic mass functions. We explicitly compute the maximum fraction of dark matter in PBH for different combinations of current constraints, allowing for total freedom of the mass function. Our framework elucidates the dependence of the maximum PBH density on the form of observational constraints, and we discuss the implications of current and future constraints for the viability of the PBH dark matter paradigm."}

From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma) with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer."}

As of this writing, HATSouth has discovered 36 transiting exoplanets. Many of the altogether ~100 HAT and HATSouth exoplanets were the first of their kind. They have been important contributors to the rapidly developing field of exoplanets, motivating and influencing observational techniques, theoretical studies, and also actively shaping future instrumentation for the detection and characterization of such objects."}
