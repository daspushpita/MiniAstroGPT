The origin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly constrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV upturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the existence of the UV upturn up to redshift 0.4 in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS survey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed magnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase the number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a few tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively small error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec aperture. By using the -band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can separate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases. We use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases. RESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift range 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by increasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range with no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past.

Here, we revisit the work of Morbidelli et al.(2012) that examined which scenario could be compatible with both the lunar crater record in the 3-4Gy period and the abundance of highly siderophile elements (HSE) in the lunar mantle. We use updated numerical simulations of the fluxes of impactors.

Kinematics measurements of these stars have revealed a stellar disk structure (with an apparent 20% disk membership) that has provided important clues to the origin of these mysterious young stars. However many of the apparent disk properties are difficult to explain, including the low disk membership fraction and the high eccentricities, given the youth of this population. Thus far, all efforts to derive the properties of this disk have made the simplifying assumption that stars at the GC are single stars. Nevertheless, stellar binaries are prevalent in our Galaxy, and recent investigations suggested that they may also be abundant in the Galactic Center. Here we show that binaries in the disk can largely alter the apparent orbital properties of the disk.

For each pixel in the disc of M33 we fit the infrared SED using a physically motivated dust model that assumes an emissivity index beta close to 2. We derive the relative amount of the different dust grains in the model, the total dust mass, and the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) heating the dust at each spatial location. The relative abundance of very small grains tends to increase, and for big grains to decrease, at high values of Halpha luminosity. This shows that the dust grains are modified inside the star-forming regions, in agreement with a theoretical framework of dust evolution under different physical conditions.

The answer to this question would help explain the origin of micro-Gauss strength magnetic fields observed in galaxies. It is also of fundamental importance in developing a complete theory of the early universe. While there can be other signatures of cosmological magnetic fields, a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would prove their primordial origin. The B-mode polarization of CMB is particularly promising in this regard because there are relatively few other sources of B-modes, and because the vortical modes sourced by the primordial magnetic field (PMF) survive diffusion damping up to a small fraction of the Silk length. At present, the Planck temperature and polarization spectra combined with the B-mode spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) constrain the PMF strength to be no more than nano-Gauss (nG). Because of the quartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound will not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the B-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments. On the other hand, tightening the bound well below the nG threshold would rule out the purely primordial origin (requiring no dynamo action) of galactic fields. Considering Faraday rotation, which converts some of the E-modes into B-modes and scales linearly with the field strength, will help to achieve this goal. As we demonstrate, the upcoming experiments, such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory, will be sensitive to fields of nG strength thanks to the mode-coupling signature induced by Faraday rotation.

Most surveys generate a vast amount of time series, or , that represent the brightness variability of stellar objects in time. Unfortunately, lightcurves' observations take several years to be completed, producing truncated time series that generally remain without the application of automatic classifiers until they are finished. This happens because state of the art methods rely on a variety of statistical descriptors or features that present an increasing degree of dispersion when the number of observations decreases, which reduces their precision. In this paper we propose a novel method that increases the performance of automatic classifiers of variable stars by incorporating the deviations that scarcity of observations produces. Our method uses Gaussian Process Regression to form a probabilistic model of each lightcurve's observations. Then, based on this model, bootstrapped samples of the time series features are generated. Finally a bagging approach is used to improve the overall performance of the classification. We perform tests on the MACHO and OGLE catalogs, results show that our method classifies effectively some variability classes using a small fraction of the original observations.

Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the power spectrum is quasi scale invariant.

Experimental conditions are systematically varied to constrain the CH3OH formation yield at astronomically relevant temperatures. CH4, O2, and hydrogen atoms are co-deposited in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at 10-20 K. OH radicals are generated by the H + O2 surface reaction. Temperature programmed desorption - quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to characterize CH3OH formation, and is complemented with reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) for CH3OH characterization and quantitation. CH3OH formation is shown to be possible by the sequential surface reaction chain, CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O and CH3 + OH -> CH3OH at 10-20 K.

One particular open question in this context is the localization of burst emission to a singular active region or a larger area across the neutron star. While several observational studies have attempted to investigate this question by looking at the phase dependence of burst properties, results have been mixed. At the same time, it is not obvious a priori that bursts from a localized active region would actually give rise to a detectable phase-dependence, taking into account issues such as geometry, relativistic effects, and intrinsic burst properties such brightness and duration. In this paper, we build a simple theoretical model to investigate the circumstances under which the latter effects could affect detectability of a dependence of burst emission on rotational phase. We find that even for strongly phase-dependent emission, inferred burst properties may not show a rotational phase dependence depending on the geometry of the system and the observer. Furthermore, the observed properties of bursts with durations short as 10-20% of the spin period can vary strongly depending on the rotational phase at which the burst was emitted.

We aim to determine the dominant mechanism responsible for these enhancements of 15N: low-temperature exchange reactions or isotope-selective photodissociation of N2. Methods: Using the thermochemical code DALI, we model the nitrogen isotope chemistry in circumstellar disks with a 2D axisymmetric geometry. Our chemical network is the first to include both fractionation mechanisms for nitrogen. The model produces abundance profiles and isotope ratios for several key N-bearing species. We study how these isotope ratios depend on various disk parameters.

What processes dominate their ISM energetics? We present an infrared spectroscopic and photometric survey of 33 SDSS-selected E+A post-starbursts, aimed at resolving these questions. We find compact, warm dust reservoirs with high PAH abundances, and total gas and dust masses significantly higher than expected from stellar recycling alone.

There is substantial scatter among SFR indicators, and both PAH and TIR luminosities provide overestimates.

Previously it was shown that the Lorentz force can be derived from this theory, albeit with deviation on the scale of a universal length constant . Here we assume that is of galactic scale and show that the modified coupling of the electromagnetic field with charged particles allows a non-Maxwellian equilibrium of non-neutral plasma.

We obtain a solution for which this mass density asymptotes approximately to that of the pseudo-isothermal model of dark matter. The resulting gravitational field produces radial acceleration, in the context of a post-Minkowskian approximation, which is negligible at small radius but yields a flat rotation curve at large radius.

We test three aspects of SEP using observed change rates in the orbital period and eccentricity of binary pulsar J1713+0747: 1. the gravitational constant's constancy as part of locational invariance of gravitation; 2. the post-Newtonian parameter in gravitational Lorentz invariance; 3. the universality of free fall (UFF) for strongly self-gravitating bodies.

We aim at reconstructing the CH3CN abundance field and investigating the gas temperature distribution as well as the velocity field. SgrB2(M) was observed with the ALMA in a spectral line survey from 211 to 275 GHz. This frequency range includes several transitions of CH3CN (including isotopologues and vibrationally excited states). We employ the three-dimensional radiative transfer toolbox Pandora in order to retrieve the velocity and abundance field by modeling different CH3CN lines. For this purpose, we base our model on the results of a previous study that determined the physical structure of SgrB2(M), i.e.\\ the distribution of dust dense cores, ionized regions and heating sources. The morphology of the CH3CN emission can be reproduced by a molecular density field that consists of a superposition of cores with modified Plummer-like density profiles. The averaged relative abundance of CH3CN with respect to H2 ranges from 4x10^{-11} to 2x10^{-8} in the northern part of SgrB2(M) and from 2x10^{-10} to 5x10^{-7} in the southern part. In general, we find that the relative abundance of CH3CN is lower at the center of the very dense and hot cores, causing the general morphology of the CH3CN emission to be shifted with respect to the dust continuum emission. The dust temperature calculated by the radiative transfer simulation based on the available luminosity reaches values up to 900 K. However, in some regions vibrationally excited transitions of CH3CN are underestimated by the model, indicating that the predicted gas temperature, which is assumed to be equal to the dust temperature, is partly underestimated.

While the solar differential rotation plays an important role in this dynamo mechanism by inducting the toroidal component of magnetic field, the impact of torsional oscillations on the dynamo mechanism and hence the solar cycle is not well understood. Here, we include the observed torsional oscillations into a flux transport dynamo model of the solar cycle to investigate their effect. We find that the overall amplitude of the solar cycle does not change significantly on inclusion of torsional oscillations. However, all the characteristics of the Waldmeier effect in the sunspot cycle are qualitatively reproduced by varying only the amplitude of torsional oscillations.

This has implications for solar cycle predictions.

We show this model is no longer consistent with data from the Milky Way rotation curve, and test two replacement models, namely NFW and power-law. The power-law model is the most flexible as it can break spherical symmetry, and best fits the data. Thus, we recommend the power-law model as a replacement, although it still lacks the flexibility to fully encapsulate all possible shapes of the Milky Way halo. We then use the power-law model to rederive some previous microlensing constraints in the literature, while propagating the primary halo-shape uncertainties through to our final constraints. Our analysis reveals that the microlensing constraints towards the Large Magellanic Cloud weaken somewhat for MACHO masses around when this uncertainty is taken into account, but the constraints tighten at lower masses. Exploring some of the simplifying assumptions of previous constraints we also study the effect of wide mass distributions of compact halo objects, as well as the effect of spatial clustering on microlensing constraints.

We show how observations from multiple wavebands, in this case optical and X-ray observations, can be used to facilitate the distinction between the two. We discovered an extremely bright and rapid transient event in optical observations of M31 with the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The persistent optical counterpart of this transient was previously thought to be a variable star in M31 without any dramatic flux excursions. The iPTF event initially appeared to be an extraordinarily rapid and energetic extragalactic transient, a very fast nova in M31 being one of the exciting possibilities, with a ~3mag positive flux excursion in less than a kilosecond. The nature of the source was resolved with the help of Chandra archival data, where we found an X-ray counterpart and obtained its X-ray spectrum. We find the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent emission can be described by a model of optically thin plasma emission with a temperature of ~7MK, typical for coronal emission from an active star. The combination of the X-ray luminosity, calculated assuming the source is located in M31 (~3.10^36 erg/s), and the color temperature exclude any type of known accreting compact object or active star in M31.

In the meantime, the continuous discovery of rotation-powered MSPs in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly with the Fermi LAT) allowed us to classify these sources into two \"spiders\" populations, depending on the mass of their companion stars: Black Widow, with very low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with larger companions possibly filling their Roche lobes but without accretion. It was soon regained that MSPs in short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations of rotation-powered MSPs, although a direct link between accretion- and rotation-powered MSPs was still missing. In 2013 XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray outburst of a new accreting MSP (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was previously classified as a radio MSP.

This early flotation crust would have formed a thermal blanket over the remaining LMO, prolonging solidification. Geochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates a long timescale of LMO cooling, or re-melting and re-crystallization in one or more late events. To better interpret this geochronology, we model LMO solidification in a scenario where the Moon is being continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from the Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped the Earth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant impact, much of it to come back on returning orbits for a period of 100 Myr. If large enough, these projectiles would have punctured holes in the nascent floatation crust of the Moon, exposing the LMO to space and causing more rapid cooling.

In this work, we aim to address the question of the possible long-term coexistence of a terrestrial companion on an orbit interior to a giant planet, and explore the extent of the stability regions for both non-resonant and resonant configurations. Our study focuses on the restricted three-body problem, where an inner terrestrial planet (massless body) moves under the gravitational attraction of a star and an outer massive planet on a circular or elliptic orbit. Using the Detrended Fast Lyapunov Indicator as a chaotic indicator, we constructed maps of dynamical stability by varying both the eccentricity of the outer giant planet and the semi-major axis of the inner terrestrial planet, and identify the boundaries of the stability domains. Guided by the computation of families of periodic orbits, the phase space is unravelled by meticulously chosen stable periodic orbits, which buttress the stability domains. We provide all possible stability domains for coplanar symmetric configurations and show that a terrestrial planet, either in mean-motion resonance or not, can coexist with a giant planet, when the latter moves on either a circular or an (even highly) eccentric orbit. New families of symmetric and asymmetric periodic orbits are presented for the 2/1 resonance. It is shown that an inner terrestrial planet can survive long time spans with a giant eccentric outer planet on resonant symmetric orbits, even when both orbits are highly eccentric.

First, we consider the case of two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) N_{1,2}, for which we provide an analytical argument why it is impossible to push the RHN mass scale below M_1^min ~ 10^10 GeV, which is identical to the value in standard thermal leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw scenario with the same washout strength. Then, we present a detailed study of the three-RHN case based on both an analytical and a numerical analysis. In the case of three RHNs, we obtain a lower bound on the N_1 mass of around 10 TeV. Remarkably enough, successful low-scale leptogenesis can be achieved without any degeneracy in the RHN mass spectrum. The only necessary condition is a suppression in the N_1 Yukawa couplings, which results in suppressed washout and a small active neutrino mass of around 10^-12 eV.

This allows for variations in the power-law slope depending on the object's semimajor axis.\\\\n\\\\In modeling NEO populations, it is essential to define key terms like 'semimajor axis', which represents an average distance from the Sun; 'eccentricity', describing the degree of elliptical shape; and 'inclination', referring to tilt relative to the solar system plane. Additionally, 'power-law slope' varies with semimajor axis in this model.\\\\n\\\\The NEO population's behavior is influenced by distinct entrance routes (ERs) from the main asteroid belt into the near-Earth region. These ERs include resonance complexes and specific populations like Hungarias and Phocaeas. The Jupiter-family comets are also included as a primary source of NEOs, contributing a few percent on average.\\\\n\\\\The model predicts that there are ( ) NEOs with ( ) absolute magnitude, which aligns with recent estimates found in the literature.\"}", "gen_calls": 3, "did_token_retry": false}, "meta": {"teacher_model": null, "max_attempts": 3}}

These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative . To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and -method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10 up to 10 solar abundances, 0 log g 6.0 and 1500 K T 50000 K.

Metallicity refers to the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen in a star's composition. Microturbulent velocity describes the random motion within a star's atmosphere. Limb-darkening coefficients are used to model how light is absorbed and scattered as it passes through a star's atmosphere.\\n\\nThe process of generating limb-darkening coefficients involves using different methods, including the least-square method for linear and bi-parametric coefficients, and a general differential equation that accounts for tidal and rotational distortions.
