The origin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly constrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV upturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the existence of the UV upturn up to redshift 0.4 in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS survey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed magnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase the number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a few tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively small error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec aperture. By using the -band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can separate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases. We use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases. RESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift range 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by increasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range with no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past.

Here, we revisit the work of Morbidelli et al.(2012) that examined which scenario could be compatible with both the lunar crater record in the 3-4Gy period and the abundance of highly siderophile elements (HSE) in the lunar mantle. We use updated numerical simulations of the fluxes of impactors. Under the traditional assumption that the HSEs track the total amount of material accreted by the Moon since its formation, we conclude that only the cataclysm scenario can explain the data.

Kinematics measurements of these stars have revealed a stellar disk structure (with an apparent 20% disk membership) that has provided important clues to the origin of these mysterious young stars. However many of the apparent disk properties are difficult to explain, including the low disk membership fraction and the high eccentricities, given the youth of this population. Thus far, all efforts to derive the properties of this disk have made the simplifying assumption that stars at the GC are single stars. Nevertheless, stellar binaries are prevalent in our Galaxy, and recent investigations suggested that they may also be abundant in the Galactic Center. Here we show that binaries in the disk can largely alter the apparent orbital properties of the disk. The motion of binary members around each other adds a velocity component, which can be comparable to the magnitude of the velocity around the SMBH in the GC. Thus neglecting the contribution of binaries can significantly vary the inferred stars' orbital properties.

For each pixel in the disc of M33 we fit the infrared SED using a physically motivated dust model that assumes an emissivity index beta close to 2. We derive the relative amount of the different dust grains in the model, the total dust mass, and the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) heating the dust at each spatial location. The relative abundance of very small grains tends to increase, and for big grains to decrease, at high values of Halpha luminosity. This shows that the dust grains are modified inside the star-forming regions, in agreement with a theoretical framework of dust evolution under different physical conditions. The radial dependence of the GDR is consistent with the shallow metallicity gradient observed in this galaxy.

The answer to this question would help explain the origin of micro-Gauss strength magnetic fields observed in galaxies. It is also of fundamental importance in developing a complete theory of the early universe. While there can be other signatures of cosmological magnetic fields, a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would prove their primordial origin. The B-mode polarization of CMB is particularly promising in this regard because there are relatively few other sources of B-modes, and because the vortical modes sourced by the primordial magnetic field (PMF) survive diffusion damping up to a small fraction of the Silk length. At present, the Planck temperature and polarization spectra combined with the B-mode spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) constrain the PMF strength to be no more than nano-Gauss (nG). Because of the quartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound will not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the B-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments. On the other hand, tightening the bound well below the nG threshold would rule out the purely primordial origin (requiring no dynamo action) of galactic fields. Considering Faraday rotation, which converts some of the E-modes into B-modes and scales linearly with the field strength, will help to achieve this goal. As we demonstrate, the upcoming experiments, such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory, will be sensitive to fields of nG strength thanks to the mode-coupling signature induced by Faraday rotation.

We have carried out visible and near-infrared photometric monitoring looking for short-term variability, with special interest in that related to the presence of a close binary companion to S106IR that may produce periodic eclipses or tidal distortion of the shape of the members of the system. A periodic variability of S106IR in the J band is found with a period of 5.0 days and an amplitude of about 0.1 mag. The light curve displays a slow rise from minimum to maximum followed by a steep decrease, and can be well reproduced by a close binary system composed of two stars with different luminosity orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit of moderate eccentricity.
